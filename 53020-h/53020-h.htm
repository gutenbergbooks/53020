<h4><a name="LIFE_OF_LEOPARDI" id="LIFE_OF_LEOPARDI">LIFE OF LEOPARDI.</a></h4>


<p>Giacomo Leopardi, the greatest Italian poet of the Nineteenth
Century, was, born at Recanati, a town of the March of Ancona, on the
twenty-ninth of June, 1798; the eldest son of Count Monaldo Leopardi,
and Adelaide, his wife, daughter of the Marquis Antici. He had four
brothers and one sister&mdash;Paolina. His father possessed a splendid
library, and was a man of learning and literary tastes, appearing
himself as an author in prose and verse.</p>

<p>Recanati is situated on an eminence in the Appenines, not far from
Ancona and the celebrated shrine of Loreto; and as a biographer of our
poet says: "Its natural beauties are superb, and the genius of its
great son has made them incomparable." Up to the age of twenty-four
Leopardi did not leave his native place. The constant sight of
so lovely a landscape, bordered in the distance by the Adriatic,
contributed in no slight measure to give him that exquisite taste and
sympathy for nature, for which he is unique among the poets of his
country.</p>

<p>He, very early, gave proofs of extraordinary ability. Of modern
languages, he knew&mdash;besides his own&mdash;English, French, German, and
Spanish. His knowledge of Greek and Latin is proved by his philological
works; and at the age of fourteen, his intimate acquaintance with
Rabbinical literature astonished some learned Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> of Ancona. But his
industry was fatal to himself. As a child he seems to have enjoyed good
health; but from the age of sixteen to twenty-one his form became bent
and his constitution weaker and weaker; and from the latter date, his
life was one series of infirmities.</p>

<p>The deepest melancholy took possession of his mind. His imagination was
of intense strength, but it served only to conjure up the gloomiest
visions. He conceived a morbid hatred of Recanati, hatred uttered in
immortal verse in the "Ricordanze." Though surrounded by those he
loved, and living in a handsome style in his father's house, life
became unendurable to him. He conceived a wild idea of flight, and
actually wrote a letter to his father, explaining his motives for so
doing. But happily the scheme was abandoned, and the letter never
delivered, although it was preserved by his brother Carlo and published
some years ago. This letter was written in July, 1819. He complains of
the little liberty that was allowed him; of the dreadful monotony of
life at I Recanati, of the little opportunity he had of exercising his
N talents to his future advantage; and of the sufferings inflicted upon
him by his "strange imagination" in the absence of all pleasure and
recreation.</p>

<p>This last complaint was certainly well-founded. If ever man required
distraction and amusement, it was Leopardi. With his self-harassing
mind, his melancholy, his delicacy of health, solitude was to him the
worst of evils. Change might have done him some good, but change was
not to come for another three years, and when it came, it was too late.</p>

<p>In the course of 1819, to his other miseries was added that of failing
sight, in consequence of overstudy. He was obliged to pass nearly
twelve months without reading or writing; and during this period he
began to meditate on the problems of life, laying the foundation of the
gloomy philosophy which was to inspire all his future productions.</p>

<p>Two years previously he had begun to correspond with the celebrated
writer, Pietro Giordani, a man of brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> intellect and generous
character, who became immediately his intense admirer and devoted
friend; and who spoke and wrote of him in terms that might then have
seemed extravagant, but which were fully justified by the event. Our
poet published, among other works of less importance, translations of
passages from the "Odyssey," and an essay on the "Popular Errors of the
Ancients."</p>

<p>But works of greater value, though of smaller dimensions, were soon
to follow. At the age of twenty he published the "Ode to Italy" and
the "Poem on the Monument of Dante;" and, two years later, one of his
masterpieces, the "Ode to Angelo Mai." It is sad to relate that Mai in
later years, instead of being grateful to the poet for addressing him
in sublime verse, depreciated his learning, and coolly appropriated the
emendations to an ancient Greek author, which had been communicated to
him by the too-confiding Leopardi. Indeed, our poet showed himself in
Greek more than a match for that celebrated scholar.</p>

<p>The winter at Recanati being cold and windy, his parents were at last
persuaded to give him leave to go to Rome in November, 1822, hoping the
milder climate would produce a beneficial effect.</p>

<p>On arriving in Rome, he wrote to his brother Carlo, confessing that
all the marvels of that city had already palled upon him, and that
his melancholy, instead of diminishing, was increasing. Nor did this
impression vanish with time. He tells his sister Paolina that the
most stupid person in Recanati had more sense than the wisest Roman.
The frivolity of society disgusted him, and even the grandeur of
the public buildings wrought a disagreeable effect upon his mind.
He made, however, some pleasant and agreeable acquaintances, among
others, the historian Niebuhr, at that time Prussian Ambassador
to the Vatican. Niebuhr conceived the highest admiration for his
talents, and spoke of him in terms of the warmest eulogy to Cardinal
Consalvi, Secretary of State to Pius VII. The Cardinal offered him
rapid promotion on condition of his entering the priesthood;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> but
not feeling the vocation, Leopardi was too conscientious to do so.
For his own prosperity this refusal was unfortunate; but we must
approve the motives that prompted it, and, indeed, we could scarcely
picture to ourselves the author of "Amore e Morte" in the garb of a
Monsignor. Pius VII. died a few months later, and Consalvi retired
from the direction of public affairs. So favourable an opportunity
never returned. Niebuhr offered our poet an appointment in Prussia;
but he declined it, dreading the long journey and the rigorous climate
of Berlin. His greatest pleasure consisted in receiving letters from
home, and when his health permitted, in pursuing his studies in the
Vatican library. The literary society of Rome was not congenial, its
exclusive devotion to antiquarian minutiae seemed to him both tedious
and trifling.</p>

<p>In May, 1823, he returned to Recanati as ailing as when he left it,
and life appeared to him more "weary, stale, flat and unprofitable"
than before. He had hoped, as he says in the "Ricordanze," that beyond
the "azure mountains" bounding his native horizon, a world of unknown
felicity extended; he had explored it, and found nothing but vanity and
affliction of spirit.</p>

<p>But as years advanced, his genius was becoming more mature, his
thoughts more profound, his style more beautiful. In 1824 he published,
at Bologna, the first edition of his "Canti," containing the three
poems already mentioned, and seven others, of which the last is that
entitled "Alla Sua Donna," which is, in the present arrangement of
his poems, the eighteenth, its former place being now occupied by
the "Primo Amore." These splendid verses show his genius in its full
meridian.</p>

<p>Two years had elapsed since his return from Rome when he received an
offer from the Milanese publisher, Stella, to undertake an edition of
the complete works of Cicero, and to reside with him whilst engaged on
this task. He accepted the invitation readily, and started in July,
1825, staying at Bologna for a month on the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> during the great
heat. Bologna he liked more than any other town he had yet seen, and he
had some agreeable friends, amongst others, the devoted Giordani. When
he arrived in Milan there were too many gaieties to please him, and he
longed to return to Bologna. He did so towards the end of September,
and stayed in Bologna until November of the following year, excepting
a short trip to Ravenna. During this period, he was occupied with
the edition of Cicero, translations from the Greek, and a commentary
on Petrarch. But the pleasure he took in Bologna did not last long;
the cold winter tried him, and he began to regret the liveliness and
hospitality of Milan.</p>

<p>Always wretched at Recanati, he still, by an amiable contradiction of
sentiment, when absent, pined for home; and in November, 1826, his
family had him again in their midst, although he was so enfeebled that
he was obliged to make the journey by short stages. It would appear
that during his sojourn at Bologna he had not been insensible to the
attractions of love, but love could be for him nothing but a source of
torment; and, as his first return home was signalised by the wreck of
hope, so was his second by the blighting of affection. He seemed like
the hero of the "Pilgrim's Progress," to be writhing in the grasp of
Giant Despair; and from the day of his arrival, till his departure in
the following April, he was not once seen in the streets of Recanati.</p>

<p>He sought a remedy for his sorrows by returning to Bologna, but in
vain; and, on the twentieth of June, 1827, he removed to Florence,
where he enjoyed the society of Giordani; but an acute inflammation
of the eyes confined him to the house, and long prevented him from
inspecting the treasures of art that overflow the Tuscan city. At this
epoch he published his "Operette Morali," a series of dialogues and
essays, offering, according to the best critics of his country, the
most perfect specimen of prose in the Italian language.</p>

<p>In the autumn he somewhat recovered, and wishing to continue the
improvement, he avoided the cold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> Florence by wintering at Pisa.
Florence, as a residence, he did not like, but with Pisa he was
enchanted. The improvement, however, was but slight, and his nerves
were in such a weak state that any sort of application or study was out
of the question. In April, 1828, he was able to apply himself again to
composition and seemed to revive; when the death of one of his brothers
afflicted him profoundly. From June to November he was again in
Florence, but his yearning for home made itself felt after the recent
bereavement.</p>

<p>He started on the twelfth of November for Recanati, in the company of
a young man, who was afterwards known to fame as Vincenzo Gioberti. He
found his birthplace darkened by the shadow of death, that seemed to
him the herald of his own. His former gloom returned, but in a more
terrible; he saw only annihilation before him, and took the last glance
of life in his superb "Ricordanze," the most richly coloured, the most
deeply pathetic, the most unfathomably profound of all his poems.</p>

<p>In 1830, his Florentine friends, wishing to have him once more in
their midst, urged his return to their city. Accordingly, in May, he
took leave of his family, little thinking he should never see them
again. It would be curious to enquire what made him so wretched when
at home, and yet, when absent, always longing to be there. His brother
Carlo said many years later to Prospero Viani, the editor of his
correspondence, that none of his poems written elsewhere had the beauty
of those composed at Recanati; and when Viani mentioned the "Ginestra,"
Carlo replied that even the "Ginestra" was conceived at Recanati. Some
biographers say the "Risorgimento" was written at Pisa, but Ranieri,
who was probably well informed, says it was written at, Recanati, and
this assertion is, I think, borne out by internal evidence. The "Canto
Notturno" seems also to have been written in his birthplace. Thus
Carlo's statement would be correct. It is observable that the poems
subsequent to the "Canto Notturno," with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> exception of "Aspasia"
and the little poem "To Himself," have an air of languor foreign to
his earlier productions. This languor is perceptible even in the
sublime "Ginestra," and it is not absent in passages of the "Pensiero
Dominante," "Amore e Morte," and the long mock-heroic "Paralipomeni."
The repose, sepulchral as it may have seemed to him, of Recanati,
and the exquisite beauty of its scenery, were conducive to the
exercise of the imagination. Nor must we forget that he spoke of other
places&mdash;except Pisa and Bologna&mdash;with equal bitterness. The climate
seems really to have worked havoc on his delicate frame. He allowed its
inhabitants only one merit, that of speaking Italian with purity and
elegance.</p>

<p>His stay in Florence, which extended from May, 1830, to October of
the following year, was made memorable by the publication of another
edition of his "Canti," with many poems added to the former ten, and
with a dedicatory epistle to his "Tuscan friends." At this period he
made the acquaintance of Ranieri, a Neapolitan with literary talents,
who was to be his intimate friend and future biographer.</p>

<p>In October, 1831, he suddenly vanished from Florence and appeared
in Rome; why, none could tell. He wrote to his brother Carlo on the
subject, begging him not to ask for the details of a long romance, full
of pain and anguish. It is conjectured that he fixed his affections
on an unworthy object and was bitterly undeceived. Whatever the
circumstances may have been, it is certain that in Rome his mental
misery, always great, rose to an intolerable height, and, sad to
relate, he for a time harboured thoughts of self-destruction But the
strength of his character overcame the strength of his affliction, and
he gradually softened to a serener mood. At this time, the Florentine
Academia della Crusea elected him a member&mdash;a worthy tribute to his
genius and eloquence. After five months sojourn in Rome he returned to
Florence, where he fell so dangerously ill that the rumour was spread
of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> decease. The doctors urged him to try a milder climate, and in
September, 1833, he set out for Naples, accompanied by Ranieri.</p>

<p>In Naples and its vicinity the remainder of his life was to be passed.
The natural beauties of the surrounding country were delightful to
one so appreciative of their charm. His health improved after a time,
and he was able to display the riches of his intellect by writing the
"Paralipomeni," many detached thoughts in prose like the "Pensées"
of Pascal and the Maxims of La Rochefoucauld; and, above all, his
philosophic and immortal poem, the "Ginestra," of which it may be said
that, had he written nothing else, his fame would be perpetuated by
this production alone.</p>

<p>In March, 1836, he who had formerly sighed so deeply for death, and
who had invoked it in such exquisite verse, felt so greatly improved
in health that he imagined he had many years before him. But this was
only the last flickering of the flame before it went out for ever.
The cholera was raging in 1837, and the prospect of falling a victim
to a mysterious and terrible disease filled him with horror. His
strange aversion to the places where he lived revived with unreasonable
violence. He wrote of Naples as a den of barbarous African savagery.
He yearned for home, and pined for his family, and the last letter
he wrote to his father&mdash;three weeks before his decease&mdash;was full of
plans for returning to Recanati, as soon as his infirmities and the
Quarantine would allow. But his earthly sorrows were drawing to a
close, and he died suddenly at Capo di Monte, when preparing to go
out for a drive, at five o'clock in the afternoon, on the fourteenth
of June, 1837, aged thirty-eight years, eleven months and sixteen
days.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "His body," says Ranieri, "saved as by a miracle from the
common and confused burial-place, enforced by the Cholera Regulations,
was interred in the suburban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> Church of San Vitale, on the road of
Pozzuoli, where a plain slab indicates his memory to the visitor." He
was slight and short of stature, somewhat bent, and very pale, with a
large forehead and blue eyes, an aquiline nose and refined features, a
soft voice, and a most attractive smile.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> His father survived him ten years; his sister, Paolina,
thirty-two years; and his brother Carlo nearly forty-one years.</p></div>

<p>From the annals of his life we proceed to the chronicle of his glory.
But to understand the poet we must have a knowledge of the man. Homer,
Shakespeare, and Ariosto can be appreciated without any acquaintance
with their lives and characters. It is not so with poets whose works
give utterance to their subjective feelings. Even Dante requires some
biographical elucidation. How much more is this the case with a writer
whose originality is so pronounced, and whose views are so coloured by
his own nature as to appear surprising, and at first alarming, to the
reader!</p>

<p>If Aristotle be right in his opinion that all great geniuses are
inclined to melancholy, Leopardi ought surely to be considered the
greatest genius that ever lived. His gloomy view of life is expressed
in every line he wrote. It draws a dark veil across the gorgeous
verses to Angelo Mai; it fills the cadences of the "Ricordanze" with
mysterious melody; and it appears in august repose in the meditations
of the "Ginestra." Not content with giving it utterance in verse, he
is sedulous to support it by reason and disquisition in prose. That
there was something morbid and diseased in it can hardly be denied,
even after we have made full allowances for the fact that his gloom is
metaphysical and transcendental, and not strictly applied, or meant to
apply to the every-day occurrences of life. But we must go further and
enquire how it came that a man of such powers of intellect yielded to
this tendency.</p>

<p>I think several explanations offer themselves, without recurring to
his physical infirmities, a solution of the problem which always gave
him the deepest offence. In the first place, we must bear in mind the
singular training, or, rather, absence of training, he experienced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
From the age of ten he had no instructors except himself. His father's
vast library quenched his thirst for knowledge; but knowledge so
acquired must necessarily be, in important respects, uncertain and
fragmentary. His ideas, never being contradicted, never influenced, and
never softened, must gradually have obtained such a hold on his mind as
to establish an eternal tyranny. An imagination of marvellous vividness
and richness was fostered by the exquisite scenery of his birthplace,
and allowed to prey upon itself in the undisturbed retirement of the
parental abode. He informs us that in his childhood he enjoyed the most
delicious visions of coming happiness. But in time the dreams were
dispelled, and truth alone remained. We all have our illusions, from
which we must sooner or later awake, but few of us take their loss so
deeply to heart as Leopardi. And this consideration makes us aware
of the fact that all his thoughts and feelings were of preternatural
depth. Others might allow themselves to be diverted from the stern
reality of things by trifles; but he stood face to face with Nature,
and saw the revelation of all her Gorgon terrors:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Natura, illaüdabil maraviglia,<br />
Che per uccider partorisci e nutrì!"<br />
<br />
"Nature, thou marvel that I cannot praise,<br />
Who givest life in order to destroy!"<br />
</p>

<p>Others might allow themselves to be consoled for the loss of love
by frivolous considerations; but he never overcame the longing for
affection that was denied him, and his misery was unvisited by comfort:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Giacqui: insensato, attonito,<br />
Non dimandai conforto;<br />
Quasi perduto e morto<br />
Il cor s' abbandonò."<br />
</p>

<p>And when the bitterness of spiritual desolation rose to such a height
that further endurance was impossible, his only prayer was for death:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"E tu, cui già dal cominciar del 'anni<br />
Sempre onorata invoco,<br />
Bella Morte, pietosa<br />
Tu sola al mondo dei terreni affanni:<br />
Se celebrata mai<br />
Fosti da me, s'al tuo divino stato<br />
L'onte del volgo ingrato<br />
Ricompensar tentai:<br />
Non tardar più, t'inchina<br />
A disusati preghi:<br />
Chiudi alla luce ornai<br />
Questi occhi tristi, o dell 'età reina!"<br />
</p>

<p>The finest passages in his poems were inspired by the deepest anguish
of his heart. Ill-health and deformity he felt as evils, chiefly
because they prevented him from appeasing his ardent yearning for love.</p>

<p>This yearning was the result of the sweetness of his disposition.
Notwithstanding his melancholy, he seems never to have been morose or
disagreeable. His heart was unblemished by spite or malignity, and he
was, by universal testimony of those who knew him, singularly moral
and upright in all relations of life. Ranieri, in his "Sette Anni di
Sodalizio," published some years ago, tries to show his faults, but the
worst he can say of him is that he was excessively choice in his diet.
This little weakness he had in common with Alexander Pope, a poet in
whom the unkindness of nature produced very different effects. Pope's
omniverous vanity could derive nourishment even from his deformities:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"There are who to my person pay their court:<br />
I cough like Horace, and, though lean, am short;<br />
Great Ammon's son one shoulder had too high;<br />
Such Ovid's nose, and 'Sir, you have an eye!'"<br />
</p>

<p>But Leopardi wrote the "Last Song of Sappho:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Placida notte, e verecondo raggio<br />
Della cadente Luna," etc.<br />
</p>

<p>Vanity seems to have entered in no way into his composition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> Nor had
he any of that ferocious vindictiveness which inspires many verses of
Pope with the venom of the deadliest vipers, though he also had his
libellers and his rivals. We know what revenge Pope took on the women
who slighted him, and with what unspeakable ribaldry he defiled them.
But Leopardi, in a similar position, wrote his incomparable "Aspasia,"
not even revealing the real name of her to whom he alludes. The most
striking instance, however, of their dissimilarity, is the difference
in their philosophy. Pope's self-complacency allowed him to indulge
in optimism, with which, however, many of his finest passages are at
variance. His intellect had sudden flashes of intense truth, but he was
not a systematic or profound thinker, and when he wanted a system of
philosophy as theme to his brilliant verse, he took that most in vogue
in his time.</p>

<p>Widely different was the development of Leopardi. He is the embodiment
in song of the spirit of pessimism, if that disagreeable word is to be
the cosmopolitan representative of what the Germans call "Weltschmerz."
His view of life is not the result of a sourness that would make
everything appear bad and unsatisfactory, but of an overweening
compassion for the sufferings of his fellow creatures. We hear his.
lamentations on the evils of life, but in his pages we see such
visions of beauty, such revelations of love, such exquisite glimpses
of nature that the world appears in his poetry more beautiful, though
more terribly and darkly beautiful, than in reality. If we analyze
a stanza or paragraph of his poems, we find a train of thought that
recurs with curious regularity. It generally opens with the most richly
coloured and delightful scenes; but when the reader is fully impressed
with their loveliness, the clouds gather, and the poet concludes with
the utterance of despair. The ode to Angelo Mai offers the earliest
instances of this in almost every stanza. It is also strikingly
exemplified in the opening paragraph of the "Vita Solitaria." Sometimes
a whole poem evolves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> this manner, like the "Primavera," and the
verses to Silvia. Such was, indeed, the progress of his life. It began
with the most radiant and heavenly visions, it was darkened by the
storms of reality, and it concluded in sorrow and in gloom. Although
his sufferings did not originate his view of life, they certainly made
him express it with more poignancy than he would otherwise have done.</p>

<p>The consideration of his philosophy leads us into the sanctuary of his
works. We have to deal exclusively with his poems, and can therefore
only bestow a passing glance on the other performances in which he
displayed the vigour of his mind.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned his classical attainments. They are attested
by a vast quantity of works, most of which were produced when he was in
his teens. Wonderful monuments of industry, they were scarcely worth
the price he paid for them: for it was in their composition that he
ruined his health by over application.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned above, the "Operette Morali" are remarkable for
their surpassing beauties of style, but they are no less so for depth,
energy, and originality of thought.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The poet in Leopardi probably
somewhat hampered the philosopher; and the philosopher may, now and
then, have prevented the poet from revelling in the flights of fancy.
Though not offering a new system of philosophy, his prose works are
well worthy of study; but were I to express my candid opinion, I
should say that the gloom which gives such tragic grandeur to his
lyrics, is somewhat out of place in essays and dialogues, and is only
redeemed by the perfection of the style. Indeed, if a foreigner may
judge, his prose is almost too perfect, its extreme finish depriving
it occasionally of energy. But no praise could be high enough for the
beautiful manner in which his phrases are balanced, for their varied
construction and noble harmony.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> There is an excellent translation of Leopardi's Prose
Works, by Charles Edwardes, in Trubner's Philosophical Series.</p></div>

<p>His poem entitled "Paralipomeni della Batracomiomachia,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> is, as the
name indicates, a sort of continuation of the Greek mock-heroic poem,
describing the "War of the Frogs and Rats." The subject is not very
happily chosen, and it is obvious that the narrative serves only to
introduce the digressions, and it is in these digressions that the
poet's brilliant imagination and felicity of style are displayed.
Certainly, since the days of Ariosto, stanzas of equal beauty had not
been produced in Italy. Still, the poem as a whole is not interesting,
although it possesses an air of gaiety and vivacity, wonderful when we
consider his habitual gloom.</p>

<p>But Leopardi's universal renown is founded on the forty-one poems and
fragments of poems, published under the collective title of "Canti;"
and it is from that collection, exclusively, that the poems in this
volume are translated.</p>

<p>In the time of Leopardi, Italian poetry had sunk to a very low ebb.
The leading poets of whom Italy could boast, were more remarkable for
graceful fancy and lively wit, than for sublimity and originality.
Parini and Alfieri alone exhibited striking intellectual qualities,
but they died when our poet was in his infancy. Parini, in whose
elegant satire all the refined frivolity of the eighteenth century
is reflected, had no great richness of invention; and Alfieri, than
whom no poet could boast of more boldness and energy of thought, was
deficient in imagination. The tuneful verse of Metastasio enchanted
Europe for fifty years; but the sweetness of his expression could not
disguise the trifling prettiness of his thoughts. Casti had vigour and
raciness enough to have made him a great satirist if he had chosen
fitter subjects for his undoubted genius than tedious apologues,
and lively, but licentious, tales. These poets were all dead before
Leopardi rose on the literary horizon, and the only established
poetical reputation he had to encounter, was that of Vincenzo Monti,
to whom he dedicated his first two Odes. If we examine the works of
Monti merely for the style, we shall find much to admire; but in
truth, nature, depth, and emotion, he was utterly deficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> The only
contemporary poets who at all approached Leopardi in intellect, were
Foscolo and Manzoni; but Foscolo, besides the disadvantage of living
in exile, frittered away his great powers on learned trifles; and
Manzoni soon deserted poetry for the more popular field of romance.
Thus it will be seen, that none of these poets were, in every respect,
admirable, nor did they, with the exception of Alfieri and Parini,
strike out new paths.</p>

<p>How necessary was an original and soaring spirit to infuse life into
the poetry of Italy! At last the poet arose whose gifts were exactly
adapted to the arduous task. That Leopardi fulfilled his mission with
brilliant success, is proved by the ever increasing influence of his
genius. During his life-time he was known only to the master-spirits
of his age, but since his death, his works have become the property
of the nation at large. His greatness is acknowledged daily more and
more, and volumes are written on his life and writings, illustrating
and examining them from every point of view, and the more his poems are
studied, the more are their beauties revealed.</p>

<p>As Carlyle said of Dante: "He is great, not because he is world-wide,
but because he is world-deep." This depth, so unfathomable, and yet so
remote from obscurity, is the first and greatest of his intellectual
qualities. Closely allied to it is his amazing originality of thought
and style. He deserted the hackneyed vehicles of expression current
in his day, the minute Sonnet and the elaborate Petrarchan Canzone.
His thoughts, for the most part, flow in an easy and pellucid style
through an alternation of rhymed and unrhymed verses. He knew, what
so few poets of modern times even suspect, the value of economy. What
he can say in one line, he does not dilute into five, If one simile
suffices for his purpose, he does not regale the reader with ten.
Bombast and grandiloquence he shunned, nay, he rather courted the
other extreme of severe simplicity. Though a man of vast learning,
he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> seldom indulged in allusions. In reading his poems we are brought
into direct contact with Nature, and with her alone, so perfectly does
he divest himself of every thought foreign to his present subject.
His verses seem the inspiration of the moment, and not the result of
elaborate study. We see him in the "Ricordanze," surveying the objects
that revive the memories of the past; we see him in the little poem to
the Moon, ascending the hill to behold the familiar radiance; we see
him in the "Ginestra," gazing on the sparkling heavens and the fiery
crater of Vesuvius, until we quite lose the sense of perusing a written
performance.</p>

<p>And yet we know that he bestowed elaborate care on his works. He says
himself that he had an ideal of unattainable perfection in his mind,
which deterred him from writing works of great extent, whether in prose
or verse. But that ideal I think he really has attained in some of
his finest poems. The merit of his works, not only in degree, but in
kind, is so immeasurably superior to that of his contemporaries, that
we cannot find a standard for judging it without going back to the
greatest masters of the art of poetry. I have no hesitation in placing
him immediately after Dante and Ariosto for strength of poetical
genius. He surpasses Petrarch in variety and comprehensiveness of mind,
although he may not always equal him in richness of style. For genuine
poetical inspiration in the purely lyrical sphere he has no rivals in
modern times except Shelley, Keats, and Goethe. To prove that this
eulogy is not exaggerated, we will now examine the "Canti" in the order
of their arrangement.</p>

<p>I. "All 'Italia." This poem, written at the age of twenty, though
appearing first in the collection, was not by any means a first attempt
at poetry. Leopardi had, it is true, up to this time devoted his
attention chiefly to learned subjects, but he had written as well a
considerable amount of verse, one of his earliest productions being a
tragedy in three acts, "Pompeo in Egitto," which shows great command of
language for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> the age of thirteen, at which it was written. We find,
therefore, in this first poem of the celebrated series, full mastery
over the mechanism of verse and fine flashes in the three opening
stanzas, but the introduction of Simonides is not a happy fiction. He
should have confined himself to the history of his own country, which
offers more striking themes than this classical reminiscence.</p>

<p>II. "Sopra il Monumento di Dante." The tyranny of Napoleon I., that
weighed so heavily on Italy in the early part of this century, is most
forcibly described, especially in the wonderful stanzas narrating
the death of the Italian troops in the Russian campaign of 1812. How
sublime are the opening lines of the tenth stanza:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Di lor querela il boreal deserto,<br />
E conscie fur le sibilanti selve."<br />
</p>

<p>The apostrophe to Dante in the fifth stanza is full of fervour; but,
perhaps the only instance of bombast to be found in our poet is the
preceding address to the sculptors.</p>

<p>III. "Ad Angelo Mai." I have mentioned above that I consider this Ode
to Angelo Mai on his discovery of Cicero's "Republic," one of our
poet's three great masterpieces. I was confirmed in this opinion by
Johannes Scherr, who, in his "Allgemeine Literaturgeschichte," extols
it as one of the sublimest Odes in any language. How great, therefore,
was my surprise on perusing Montefredini's Life of Leopardi, to find
that the author has nothing but blame and ridicule for this poem. He,
though so ardent an admirer of Leopardi, cannot find words strong
enough to express his contempt for such rubbish. We may, indeed,
agree with him, that the discovery of an old manuscript by a monk
is scarcely an event of sufficient importance to warrant poetical
raptures. But if we condemn all poems that take their starting point
from a slight occurrence, we must begin by denying merit to Pindar,
for what can be more intrinsically trivial than the foundation on
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> he builds his lofty fabrics? It is further a mystery to me how
Montefredini can understand the eighth stanza to allude to Tasso, when
it is obvious that it applies to no one but Ariosto, and is a most
exquisite description of the effect produced by that poet on the mind,
offering, perhaps, the finest passage in a poem replete with beauties.
How sublime are the verses on Columbus, and how picturesque is the
lamentation on the decline of the imaginative powers!</p>

<p>IV. "Nelle Nozze della Sorella Paolina." This poem on a marriage
that never took place, but was only projected, is not equal to its
predecessors, but it is nevertheless original, and in parts forcible,
and full of patriotic inspiration. His sister was the only member of
his family whom he has immortalized in verse.</p>

<p>V. "A un Vincitore nel Pallone." I did not think it necessary to
translate this ode, as it only repeats feebly what its predecessors
uttered energetically. These five poems form a distinct class, the
patriotic, in our poet's works. Henceforth his horizon becomes wider,
and he laments, not only the sorrows of Italy, but those of all mankind.</p>

<p>VI. "Bruto Minore." In the foregoing poems Leopardi plays, as it were,
a prelude; but now the curtain rises on the tragedy of his life. To
avoid justifying his despair, he puts his soliloquy into the mouth
of Brutus, after the disaster of Phillipi. There are flashes in the
poem that seem to illuminate an abyss of misery and gloom, and here he
first gives utterance to one of those piercing laments which make his
subsequent poems so impressive:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"O casi! O gener vano! Abbietta parte<br />
Siam delle cose."<br />
</p>

<p>He himself looked upon this as one of his most remarkable poems, but
I cannot consider it one of the most beautiful; the thoughts are not
always presented with all possible force, and the odd idea of animals
committing suicide is rather ludicrous. But the poem is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> full of
significance. Montefredini observes very justly: "It is the first
wail of his tortured soul, the first malediction against the cruelty
of Nature. The sentiment is powerful, and rushes forth furiously. So
young, he is utterly miserable, and his opinions of life and the world
are already full of despair. Even the calm aspect of nature wounds
him as though it were an insult to his sorrow, a cruel mocking of
the tempest of the soul.... The physical and mental life of Leopardi
assumed too soon a fatal bent. As in his youth his bodily sufferings
were excessive, so are his early poems finally and immensely sad. No
other youthful poems contain so much despair or proceed from such
a bleeding heart. Leopardi buries himself in his immense sorrow,
deserting the region of airy fancy in which young poets delight....
This tumult of emotion proves that he had not yet resigned himself to
his fate. He was not born for such bitter utterance, nor are these the
fit inspirations of early poetry. Instead of the beautiful themes of
joy, hope and fond desire, our poet can only sing of his despair."</p>

<p>VII. "Alla Primavera." He was too much of a poet to desert the realms
of fancy without a glance of affectionate regret, and in this poem to
Spring, he conjures up with magic voice the fables of the past. Between
the gloom of Brutus and the radiant loveliness of these visions,
how great is the contrast! This is, in my opinion, one of the most
elaborate and polished of his productions, and I am again obliged to
differ from Montefredini as to the merits of this Ode.</p>

<p>VIII. "Inno ai Patriarchi." This hymn also has the misfortune of
not pleasing Montefredini. Still, it contains passages wonderfully
picturesque, and is a worthy fruit of our poet's intimate acquaintance
with Hebrew literature.</p>

<p>IX. "Ultimo Canto di Saffo." As in the monologue of Brutus, Leopardi
uttered his own views of life; so in the "Last Song of Sappho" he
expresses how keenly he felt his physical afflictions. How august
and calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> is the opening, and how beautifully the poet blends his
sorrow with the description of Nature! The third stanza rises to
Æschylean sublimity. Two spirits seem to be battling for mastery
over the poet&mdash;the one pronouncing, the other lamenting, his doom.
Most beautiful is the effect achieved by the mysterious pathos of the
conclusion.</p>

<p>X. "Il Primo Amore." After such a poem we almost doubt whether we shall
read further&mdash;whether any other poem can be read after that supreme
effort. But the "Primo Amore," though different in kind, is, as poetry,
equally valuable. The former piece astonished us with its sublimity;
this delights us with its delicacy. For depth of feeling and reality of
narration I know no love poem that surpasses it; but here and there we
find some obscurity and flatness in the diction.</p>

<p>XI. "Il Passero Solitario." Not one of the least admirable qualities
of our poet is the great variety of expression he commands. The five
patriotic poems may be considered as producing one effect; but each
of the following is quite distinct from its predecessor, and the
"Passero Solitario" is again quite different from them all. It is also
remarkable as the first poem in his later manner&mdash;that of the "Canto
Notturno" and the "Ginestra." It is an idyl such as Theocritus, or,
rather, Wordsworth, might have written. The gloom is past, the despair
at rest, a gentle pensiveness alone remains. The picture of the setting
sun:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Che tra lontani monti,</span><br />
Dopo il giorno sereno,<br />
Cadendo si dilegua, e par che dica<br />
Che la beata gioventù vien meno,"<br />
</p>

<p>always seemed to me the most perfect instance of subjective colouring
of nature in the whole range of poetry.</p>

<p>XII. "L'Infinito." This little gem concentrates in a few lines the
lustre of the richest poetry. The more we examine it, the more we
admire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>XIII. "La Sera del Dè di Festa." Though not equal to its four immediate
predecessors, I think this poem worthy of high admiration for the
delicacy and rapidity of its transitions. It is wonderful to observe
with what ease the poet rises from simplicity to sublimity, and returns
again to simplicity. What perfection of art and what discrimination of
style!</p>

<p>XIV. "Alla Luna." A more tender sigh was never breathed in song than
here. I wish I could have done justice to the exquisite lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"E tu pendevi allor su quella selva<br />
Siccome or fai, che tutta la rischiari."<br />
</p>

<p>XV. "Il Sogno" is a very trifling production, with a few lines worthy
of its author, but too insignificant to deserve translation.</p>

<p>XVI. "La Vita Solitaria." The second paragraph contains the finest
poetical illustration I know of what Schopenhauer calls "Willensfreie
Anschauen," and is in our poet's noblest style; the concluding
apostrophe to the Moon is very animated, but the poem is disjointed and
incoherent, and each paragraph would make a separate poem.</p>

<p>XVII. "Consalvo." If we were to judge from internal evidence alone, we
should say that this production was the work of a feeble and unskilful
imitator of our poet; so indifferent in execution as to be almost a
parody on his manner. Hysterical, exaggerated, and heavy, it offers
not one spark of his genius. Here, for once, Montefredini's unsparing
severity is in the right place; I have therefore omitted it in my
translation.</p>

<p>XVIII. "Alla Sua Donna." This poem was the tenth in the first edition
of the "Canti." I do not know, why the poet removed it to its present
place in the edition of 1837. It is eminently beautiful, and written
throughout in the author's happiest style. As the expression of a
yearning towards a superhuman ideal, it is peerless. There is nothing
more sublime in Petrarch.</p>

<p>XIX. "Al Conte Carlo Pepoli." This epistle is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> somewhat Horation in
diction, with some beautiful thoughts and charming verses, but not so
characteristic of the author as to be essential to a translation. It
might have been written by a less distinguished poet than Leopardi. It
is, however, a proof of his great variety of style.</p>

<p>XX. "Il Risorgimento" is the pearl of this collection.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Credei ch'ai tutto fossero<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In me, sul fier degl 'anni,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Mancati i dolci affanni</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Della mia prima età:</span><br />
I dolci affanni, i teneri<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Moti del cor profondo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Qualunque cosa al mondo</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Grato il sentir ci fa."</span><br />
</p>

<p>What melody and sweetness of style! How richly h e describes his gloom,
and how vividly his revival to the joys of life!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Meco ritorna a vivere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">La piaggia, il bosco, il monte;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Parla al mio core il fonte,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Meco favella il mar."</span><br />
</p>

<p>And how noble is the conclusion:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Mancano, il sento, all anima,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Alta, gentile e pura,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">La sorte, la natura,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Il mondo e la beltà.</span><br />
Ma se tu vivi, O misero,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Se non concedi al fato,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Non chiamerò spietato</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Chi lo spirar mi dà."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of the other poems I hope I have been able to give an almost adequate
rendering; but of this, such a rendering was impossible. The sense is
so blended with the music of the verse, and the music is so peculiar to
the Italian language, that I doubt whether any translation could ever
do it full justice. It is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> unique among his works. He never wrote
anything before or afterwards even remotely like it. He seems to have
revelled in the sweetness of the melody, and to have sported with his
sorrow in the music of the lines.</p>

<p>XXI. "A Silvia." The subject of this poem was a young girl of Recanati,
whom the poet and his brother Carlo used frequently to see in their
young days. It is a beautiful specimen of his almost supernatural
powers of concentration and depth. From bewailing her untimely end,
the poet rises to contemplate the vanity of earthly things. "Before
such masterpieces," Montefredini justly observes, "as 'Silvia' and the
'Passero Solitario,' we are struck dumb with admiration." It is an
instance of how powerful an effect a great writer can produce by slight
means.</p>

<p>XXII. "Le Ricordanze." If I were asked to award the palm to one above
all the other "Canti," I should name the "Ricordanze." It offers a
combination of the rarest beauties. Possessing the highest biographical
interest as a picture of his youth, it invests all the visions it
conjures up with the richest poetical colouring. The reader will
observe how simple is the opening, and how the verses gradually rise in
thought and style until they reach the splendid outburst:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">"E che pensieri immensi,</span><br />
Che dolci sogni mi spirò la vista<br />
Di quel lontano mar, quei monti azzurri,<br />
Che di qua scopro, e che varcare un giorno<br />
Io mi pensava, acani mondi, acana<br />
Felicità fingendo al viver mio!"<br />
</p>

<p>This superb passage is concluded with the utterance of tragic emotion:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Ignaro del mio fato, e quante volte<br />
Questa mia vita dolorosa e nuda<br />
Volentier con la morte avrei cangiato."<br />
</p>

<p>Then, by a natural transition, he introduces the celebrated imprecation
on Recanati, the energy of which leads us to forget its injustice. How
beautifully is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> youth called "the solitary flower of barren life!"
Still more beautiful is the following paragraph with its description
of happy childhood. The apostrophe to his vanished hopes is full of
sublimity, as also the picture of his gloomy meditations. The two
last paragraphs make a worthy conclusion, especially the transcendant
passage on Nerina, to which no parallel can be found in the whole range
of lyric poetry.</p>

<p>XXIII. "Canto Notturno di un Pastore Errante dell' Asia." This poem
was suggested by a passage in Baron Meyendorffs "Voyage d'Orenbourg à
Boukhara," quoted in the "Journal des Savans," for September, 1826,
where, speaking of a nomadic tribe of Asia, he says: "Plusieurs d'entre
eux passent la nuit assis sur une pierre à regarder la lune, et à
improviser des paroles assez tristes sur des airs qui ne le sont pas
moins." Some critics are inclined to place the "Canto Notturno" above
all other productions of our poet, and the opening is indeed divine:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Che fai tu, Luna, in ciel? dimmi, che fai,<br />
Silenziosa Luna?<br />
Sorgi la sera, e vai,<br />
Contemplando i deserti; indi ti posi.<br />
Ancor non sei tu paga<br />
Di riandare i sempiterni calli?<br />
Ancor non prendi a schivo, ancor sei vaga<br />
Di mirar queste valli?"<br />
</p>

<p>"The picture of life in the second stanza," says Montefredini, "is as
gloomily sublime as anything ever written of a similar nature. It seems
laden with the sighs of oppressed humanity. And what repose amidst
the universal darkness! What a style!&mdash;like the voice of an immortal.
All is solemn, immense, eternal. This poem will ever be the poem of
all nations&mdash;the noblest and grandest expression of human sorrow."
Great praise is also due to the skill with which the poet preserves the
character he has assumed. The shepherd does not enter into abstruse and
subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> speculations&mdash;he only gives utterance to a vague wonder at the
mystery of things, and this vagueness makes the poem deeply impressive.
But still there remains something unsatisfactory in the latter part,
and the gloom of the conclusion is exaggerated.</p>

<p>XXIV. "La Quiete dopo la Tempesta" is a feeble copy of verses. There is
a lovely touch of natural description:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">"Ecco il sereno</span><br />
Rompe là da ponente, alla montagna;<br />
Sgombrasi la campagna,<br />
<i>E chiaro nella valle il fiume appare.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>Otherwise it offers nothing remarkable.</p>

<p>XXV. "Il Sabato del Villaggio" opens with an exquisitely idyllic
description of a girl returning with flowers from a country ramble, and
of an old woman relating the memories of her youth, while spinning with
her neighbours. The description of evening is worthy of Wordsworth:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Già tutta l'aria imbruna,<br />
Torna azzurro il sereno, e tornan l'ombre<br />
Giù da colli e da' tetti,<br />
Al biancheggiar della recente luna."<br />
</p>

<p>But the remainder of the poem is insufferably languid and trivial.
Those two pieces are omitted in translation.</p>

<p>XXVI. "Il Pensiero Dominante" is an instance of our poet's mighty
originality. It is as profound as a chorus of Æschylus, and fathoming
its mystic depths is like venturing on an unknown ocean. The simile of
the Pilgrim is strikingly beautiful, and more so in a poet singularly
sparing of such ornaments.</p>

<p>XXVII. "Amore e Morte" equals its predecessor in originality, and
surpasses it in tenderness. The Greek simplicity and purity of style
conceal the morbid and diseased sources of its inspiration. The
apostrophe to death is the most fervent prayer ever uttered in song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>XXVIII. "A Se Stesso" is the only poem of Leopardi that is from
beginning to end utterly gloomy, bitter and despairing. All his other
poems have at least glimpses of beauty and serenity, but here there are
none.</p>

<p>XXIX. "Aspasia." The passion rushes forth wildly and ungovernably in
this outburst of unrequited affection. Every word betrays how deeply
he loved the woman to whom it is addressed. It seems to me worthy of a
high rank among his poems, as proving how fully he enters into every
subject he treats. His embodiment of an abstruse metaphysical idea in
the most impassioned poetry is above all praise.</p>

<p>XXX. "Sopra un Basso Rilievo Antico Sepolcrale" is deficient in warmth
of colouring, but the apostrophe to Nature and the pathetic conclusion
are fine.</p>

<p>XXXI. "Sopra il Ritratto di una Bella Donna" is a feeble echo of the
former not very successful poem, and is, therefore, omitted in our
translation.</p>

<p>XXXII. "Palinodia al Marchese Gino Capponi." This is the only satire
in this collection, but it does not equal the satiric vigour shown
in the mock-heroic "Paralipomeni." The humour is forced and the
style heavy, an unhappy imitation of Parini's elaborate irony. It is
written to prove that the inventions of modern times do not add to the
real happiness of mankind. I have omitted it, because not offering a
favourable sample of our poet's lighter manner.</p>

<p>XXXIII. "Il Tramonto della Luna" is a lamentation on the infirmities
of old age, written at a time when the poet imagined his life would
be prolonged. It has some affinity to the conclusion of the "Passero
Solitario," but the earlier poem is truer, because more moderately
expressed.</p>

<p>XXXIV. "La Ginestra o il Fiore del Deserto." The last four poems
were not in our author's highest strain, but in the "Ginestra" he
summoned all his dying powers, and left a sublime legacy to the world.
"Ineffable poetry!" exclaims Giordani, "full of thunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> and lightning
and funereal depth." We need not insist on its beauties, on the noble
opening, on the picturesque descriptions of the Vesuvius in the
latter part, descriptions that enhance and illustrate the philosophic
meditations. Giordani was of opinion that it was his best work, and
it certainly surpasses the others in one respect: it is characterised
by a spirit of sublime repose, resignation, and sweetness&mdash;a worthy
conclusion of his poetical career. But I do not doubt that many pieces
in this collection are more attractive to the general reader.</p>

<p>The remaining seven numbers of the "Canti" consist only of fragments
and translations. The eighteen opening lines of the fragment beginning:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Spento il diurno raggio in Occidente."<br />
</p>

<p>offer a splendid description of a moonlight night.</p>

<p>And now that we have passed in review the works of this great poet,
we enquire wherein lies the charm, the irresistible charm, of his
writings. That charm has been felt by the greatest minds of the
century, and by many who have no sympathy with his philosophy. Alfred
de Musset, who had certainly little in common with the man or the
poet, wrote enthusiastic verses on the "sombre amant de la mort," and
declared that in the small volume of his poems more was to be found
than in works of epic length.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the secret of his power lies in the
unique and exquisite contrast between the bitterness and gloom of his
thoughts and the sweetness and radiant beauty of his style. When other
poets give utterance to their misery and despair, they impart a sable
colouring to their diction. Not so Leopardi. He can exclaim:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"So che natura é sorda,<br />
Che miserar non sa."<br />
</p>

<p>But the verses are steeped in loveliness and melody. Such is the first
and most powerful cause of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> effect he produces. Next we must
place, though higher in absolute merit, his quality of depth. With
the exception of Shakespeare and Dante, there is, I think, no poet
of modern times who equals him in depth of thought. Every subject he
treats he pierces to the core. Other poets may delight us with airier
and more brilliant flights of fancy, but Leopardi leads us to the brink
of abysses, and shews us their unfathomable depth. Fully to enjoy this
power we must read his finest passages slowly, and let each verse
saturate the mind. Hence the impression, after reading his "Canti,"
that we have perused, not a small collection of short poems, but a work
of mighty design like "King Lear," or "Prometheus."</p>

<p>The third cause of his greatness, but one that will weigh more with
critics than with the general public, is the austere severity of his
taste, which confines him strictly within the boundaries of his genius.
He never allows himself to enter an arena for which he knows himself
unfitted. He always remains purely poetical. He is never, except in
a few passages of his earliest poems, declamatory, and even when the
subject is philosophical, he avoids becoming merely moralizing. Hence
his productions are perfect of their kind. We must also allow him the
merit of never being tedious, and the skill of choosing attractive
subjects. But what will probably most endear him to posterity, is
the profound pathos, the human sympathy, he displays. From his own
sufferings he learnt to feel for those of all mankind.</p>

<p>With regard to this translation, it has been my endeavour to render my
author's thoughts as accurately as possible; and whatever merits my
version may lack, it has at least the merit of fidelity. Fortunately,
the great freedom of Leopardi's metres makes fidelity not very
difficult to attain. Many of his poems are in blank verse, others in
a very peculiar union of rhymed and unrhymed iambic verses of eleven
and seven syllables. It is curious to observe how the poet in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
latter works more and more discards rhyme, as if it were too frivolous
an ornament for his lofty meditations, the harmonious effect being
produced by exquisite choice of words, and skilful variety of cadence.
Several poems are written in regular stanzas, but with some unrhymed
lines. I have translated the second, third, and sixth poems exactly in
the metrical arrangement of the original, with the same succession of
rhymed and unrhymed verses, only making the last line of each stanza
an Alexandrine. The "Last Song of Sappho," is also in the metre of the
original, but I always conclude regular stanzas with an Alexandrine.
Other poems in regular stanzas I have rendered without reference to the
rhymes of the original, with the exception of the "Primo Amore" and
the "Risorgimento." Italian critics do not find fault with Leopardi's
capricious use of rhymed and unrhymed verses, but I should have
scrupled to introduce it into the English language, had I not found
in Milton's "Lycidas" a precedent for so doing. In that poem there
are some verses without rhyme, though not so many as in Leopardi's
compositions; but in "Samson Agonistes," we find the chorus using
rhymes or not, with unlimited freedom.</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">On His Discovering the Books of Cicero on the<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dauntless Italian! why dost thou not rest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From waking in the tomb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our old forefathers? And why bid them hold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discourse unto this age so lost in gloom</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of worn exhaustion? Wherefore, voice of old,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Appealest thou so often to our ears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For centuries though dumb?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is the reason of this mighty change?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As rapidly as lightning's flash, the page</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bearing enshrined the glorious wisdom's range</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those ancestral minds. What daring rage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth Fate give to thy soul, Italia's pride?</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Or is it Fate who vainly human worth defied?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Truly, it is by Heaven's high design</span><br />

<br />
And you the song of unrejoicing sons,<br />
Ye lofty fathers of the human race,<br />
Shall celebrate with praise; ye far more dear<br />
Unto the eternal Ruler of the stars,<br />
And much less sorrowing brought unto the light<br />
Sublime than we. Not piety and not<br />
The laws of Heaven imposed the unceasing ills<br />
That now afflict mankind, for sorrow born,<br />
And destined to discover greater joy<br />
In the nocturnal shadows of the tomb<br />
Than in the radiance of the orb of day.<br />
And if an ancient legend still doth tell<br />
The story of your ancient error dire<br />
That yielded man unto the tyranny<br />
Of suffering and grief; the guilt more fell,<br />
The more unquiet minds and frenzy fierce<br />
Of your descendants made the injured skies<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>And Nature, in return for all her cares<br />
Spumed and neglected, feel indignant wrath:<br />
From which the fire of life a curse received,<br />
And mothers trembled at the load they bore,<br />
And Hell itself was imaged on the earth.<br />
<br />
Thou first, O father of the human race,<br />
Didst see the sparkling of revolving spheres,<br />
The new-born generations of the fields,<br />
The breezes roving o'er the infant trees,<br />
When towering rocks and yet unpeopled vales<br />
Heard for the first time Alpine fury sound<br />
Of rushing torrents; when unconscious Peace<br />
Reigned o'er the destined regions of renowned<br />
Nations and cities full of strife and noise;<br />
And when upon uncultivated hills<br />
Silent and lonely did the radiance shine<br />
Of sun and moon. Oh happy then, ignoring<br />
Events disastrous and the name of guilt,<br />
The vast abode of earth! Oh, how much grief<br />
Unto thy race, thou Father full of sorrow!<br />
How long a series of most bitter deeds<br />
The Fates prepare! The soil, behold! is stained<br />
With deepest crimson of a brother's blood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>By brother shed, and o'er the sky divine<br />
The wings of Death their evil shadow throw.<br />
The fratricide with horror taketh flight,<br />
Shunning the lonely dimness of the shades<br />
And secret wrath of winds in forest deep;<br />
He is the first to build proud towns, henceforth<br />
Domain and dwelling of Care's pallid form;<br />
And first Remorse despairing fixeth man<br />
In a pent-up and undelightful home.<br />
Then from the plough the guilty hand was ta'en,<br />
And scorn was cast on labours of the field,<br />
And the evil halls became the home of sloth.<br />
All minds lay languid and of strength bereft<br />
In weary frames; and as the last and worst<br />
Of ills, mankind by slavery was bound.<br />
<br />
And thou from pouring skies and rolling seas<br />
That lashed the summits of the cloudy peaks,<br />
Didst save the germ of the ill-fated race,<br />
O thou to whom from sable space of air<br />
And from the mountains floating in the deep,<br />
A sign of hope restored by snowy dove<br />
Was brought; and from the ancient clouds emerging,<br />
The troubled sun upon the skies obscure<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>Painted the bow of many beauteous hues.<br />
The rescued race returns unto the earth,<br />
Renewing evil deeds and ruthless thoughts<br />
And their pursuing terrors. To the reign<br />
Of oceans inaccessible it shows<br />
Its vengeful might, and beareth tears and grief<br />
To stars unknown and to remotest shores.<br />
<br />
Now thee within my heart I meditate,<br />
And of thy race the generous descendants,<br />
Thou just and valourous father of the pious!<br />
I shall relate how, seated in the calm<br />
Meridian shadows of a quiet home,<br />
Beside the meads so dear unto thy flocks,<br />
Thy soul was blest by strangers from the Heavens<br />
Ethereal and disguised; and how, O son<br />
Of wise Rebecca! in the evening hour<br />
Beside the rustic well and in the vale<br />
Of Haran, cherished by the gentle shepherds<br />
In their gay leisure, love inspired thy heart<br />
For Laban's beauteous daughter: love supreme,<br />
Who to long exile and affliction long,<br />
And to the hated yoke of servitude,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Made many a soul of haughty strength submit.<br />
<br />
Once, truly once (nor with mere shadows idle<br />
Aonian song and legendary lore<br />
Delude mankind), this globe of ours benign<br />
And dear and pleasant to our race appeared,<br />
And golden was the tenour of our age.<br />
Not that with milk the fertile springs rushed forth,<br />
And from the mountains to the valleys spread;<br />
Nor with the flocks the tiger did resort<br />
In happy peace; nor with the wolves the shepherd<br />
Proceeded gaily to the crystal fount;<br />
But that our humankind lived without grief,<br />
Unconscious of the fate that o'er it hung,<br />
And of the woes impending; the sweet error,<br />
The fond delusions, and the pleasing veil<br />
Across the laws of Heaven and Nature thrown,<br />
Were all sufficient; and our quiet bark<br />
Was led into the haven of calm Hope.<br />
<br />
Thus, in the boundless forests of the West<br />
Liveth a happy race, whom pallid Care<br />
Pursueth not, whose members are not wasted<br />
By dire disease; to whom the trees yield fruit;<br />
Abode, the caverns kind; refreshing drink,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>The rivulets and brooks; and as her prey<br />
Death claims them unforeseen. Alas! 'gainst our<br />
Unhallowed daring, how defenceless are<br />
The haunts of Nature wise! our dauntless fury<br />
Doth penetrate the shores and caves remote<br />
And quiet forests, teaching the despoiled<br />
Desires and sorrows which they never knew,<br />
And hunting Happiness, aghast and naked,<br />

<span class="title">THE FIRST LOVE.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The day once more within my memory lives</span><br />
When first I felt the affray of Love, and said:<br />
"Ah me, if this be Love, what pangs he gives!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unto the earth I bent mine eyes and head,</span><br />
Beholding her from whom my heart did learn<br />
The first and stainless passion whence it bled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love, to dire goal thou didst my fancy turn!</span><br />
Why should so tender an affection sting<br />
With such desire, such agonies that burn?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why not serene, and with unfettered wing,</span><br />
Why full of frenzy and of loud lament<br />
Into my heart didst thou thy joyaunce bring?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell me, my tender heart, what terror sent</span><br />
A shaft through thee, what anguish 'mid the thought,<br />
Beside which paled whate'er was once content?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That thought by day with flattering pleasure fraught.</span><br />
By night as well, unto my mind appeared,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>When worlds the silence of deep shadows sought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Restless, yet happy, though to grief endeared,</span><br />
Thou on my pillows didst alarm my frame<br />
With palpitations, every minute feared.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And where I sad and grieved and weary came</span><br />
To close mine eyes in slumber, feverish fire<br />
And frenzy roused me, sleep could never tame.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How 'mid the shades, the queen of my desire</span><br />
Uprose with vivid splendour, and mine eyes<br />
Gazed on her closed, the lids not rising higher!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many a thrill of sweet emotion flies</span><br />
Through my glad frame which joyous ardours seize!<br />
How many thoughts within my soul arise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uncertain, undefined! Thus 'mid the trees</span><br />
Of ancient forests doth a murmur sound,<br />
Vague, deep of tone, in answer to the breeze.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whilst in silence all my thoughts were bound,</span><br />
What said'st thou, heart, when she went far away,<br />
For whom a world of passion thou hadst found?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I scarce within me felt the heat a day,</span><br />
Arising from Love's furnace, when the air<br />
Whereon it came, to scenes remote did stray.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At early dawn I lay in sleepless care;</span><br />
Before our house the horses pranced, ere long<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>To make me of my only joyaunce bare!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I, to whom misgivings vague belong,</span><br />
These orbs did idly in the shadows strain,<br />
And forced my hearing with an effort strong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To catch the voice, last token I could gain</span><br />
From the fair lips of her whom I revere:<br />
All else, alas! hath Heaven from me ta'en.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many a time struck on my doubtful ear</span><br />
Plebean cries and accents, and I froze<br />
In all my frame, my heart appalled with fear!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when at last within my heart I close</span><br />
The voice so well beloved, and hear the race<br />
Of wheels and horses as the carriage goes:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowing myself despoiled, I hide my face,</span><br />
And shut mine eyes, and sink upon my bed,<br />
And sigh, and on my heart my hand I place.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">After a while with wavering limbs I tread</span><br />
As one amazed, along the silent room,<br />
And "What power else hath struck my heart?" I said.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then the remembrance with most bitter gloom</span><br />
Settled within my bosom; and my soul<br />
Became to all the scenes of life a tomb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seas of anguish through my being roll,</span><br />
And I did feel as when the torrents drear<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Pour from the clouds, and shades o'ercast the whole<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Space of the sky; nor born for many a tear,</span><br />
Knew I the youth of vanished years twice nine,<br />
When, Love, thou first didst in full power appear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When for all pleasure scorn alone was mine,</span><br />
Nor dear the quiet dawn or meadows green<br />
Or joyous radiance of the stars that shine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love of glory was no more the queen</span><br />
Of this my soul, which it before did burn,<br />
For love of beauty reigned there all serene.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wonted studies no more thoughts I turn,</span><br />
And those unto my fancy idle seem<br />
For which all other thoughts I used to spurn.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! I myself another self must deem</span><br />
That so much love another love hath ta'en!<br />
We are, in truth, vain as an empty dream!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only my heart did please me, and we twain</span><br />
In an eternal dialogue immersed,<br />
I loved to sit, the guardian of my pain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mine eyes bent on the ground or else inversed</span><br />
Within myself, on lovely face to gaze<br />
Or on a form unpleasing, never durst:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the unspotted image to erase</span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>As calm lakes ruffle when the zephyr plays.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the remorse that not enough I cheered</span><br />
My heart with joy, a thought so full of pain<br />

For shame could not my cloudless soul appal,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Heaven, to you, ye gentle lovers all,</span><br />
I swear no evil will did in me strive,<br />
None could my fire base and ignoble call.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That fire yet lives, my love is yet alive,</span><br />
Still in my thought the beauteous image reigns,<br />
Whence other joys than from the skies derive,<br />

<span class="title">THE LONELY BIRD.</span><a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Upon the summit of the ancient tower<br />
Unto the land around, thou, lonely bird,<br />
Carollest sweetly till the evening hour,<br />
And through the vale thy melody is heard.<br />
Spring makes the gentle air<br />
Fragrant and bright, and animates the fields,<br />
Bidding the gazer in his heart rejoice.<br />
Hark to the lowing herds, the flocks that bleat,<br />
The other birds that full of joyaunce sing<br />
And in the air in happy circles meet,<br />
As though they homage to their fair time bring.<br />
Thou, full of thought, beholdest all aside,<br />
Nor carest to take wing<br />
With thy companions, scorning their delight.<br />
Thou singest, and the flower<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>Of spring thus fadeth with thy life's sweet hour.<br />
<br />
Ah me! how like to thine<br />
My habit doth appear! Pleasure and mirth,<br />
The happy offspring of our earlier age,<br />
And thou, Youth's brother, Love,<br />
Thou bitter sigh of our advancing years.<br />
I heed not; why, I cannot tell; but far<br />
From them I take my way;<br />
And like a hermit lone,<br />
Nor to my birthplace known,<br />
I see the spring of my existence die.<br />
This day that now is yielding to the night.<br />
Was in our hamlet ever festive held.<br />
Upon the air serene the bells resound<br />
And frequent firing of the distant guns,<br />
Arousing the deep echoes far and wide.<br />
In festival attire<br />
The youths and maidens go,<br />
Leaving their homes, upon the country paths,<br />
Rejoicing to be seen and to admire.<br />
I to this tower, remote<br />
From sight of men, repairing all alone,<br />
All joy and mirth postpone<br />
For other times; and as I gaze on high,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>The sun doth strike mine eye;<br />
Beyond the summit of yon mountain far,<br />
After the day serene,<br />
He sinketh to his rest, and seems to say<br />
That happy youth is leaving me for aye.<br />
<br />
Thou, lonely warbler, coming to the close<br />
Of what the stars have granted thee to live,<br />
In truth of these thy ways<br />
Shalt not complain, for Nature on thee lays<br />
Thy fondness of repose.<br />
To me, if of old age<br />
The dreaded terrors stern<br />
I cannot from me turn,<br />
When to no heart this soul of mine can yearn,<br />
When void the earth will be, the future day<br />
More than the present, wearisome and grey:<br />
How will this lone mood seem?<br />
What shall I of myself in past years deem?<br />
Ah me! repent too late,<br />
And often gaze behind disconsolate.<br />

<span class="title">THE INFINITE.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
I always loved this solitary hill<br />
And this green hedge that hides on every side<br />
The last and dim horizon from our view.<br />
But as I sit and gaze, a never-ending<br />
Space far beyond it and unearthly silence<br />
And deepest quiet to my thought I picture,<br />
And as with terror is my heart o'ercast<br />
With wondrous awe. And while I hear the wind<br />
Amid the green leaves rustling, I compare<br />
That silence infinite unto this sound,<br />
And to my mind eternity occurs,<br />
And all the vanished ages, and the present;<br />
Whose sound doth meet mine ear. And so in this<br />
Immensity my thought is drifted on,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>And to be wrecked on such a sea is sweet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="title">THE HOLIDAY NIGHT.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The night is fair, without a breath of wind,<br />
And on the roofs and gardens full of peace<br />
The moon reposes and reveals afar<br />
Each mountain all serene. O my beloved!<br />
The haunts of men are silent; in their homes<br />
Rarely doth glimmer a nocturnal lamp.<br />
Thou art asleep, by gentle slumber wrapped<br />
Within thy quiet room; no carking care<br />
Disturbs thy rest; nor dost thou know or think<br />
How deep a wound thou openedst in my heart.<br />
Thou art asleep; I sally forth to greet<br />
The firmament, to gaze on so benign,<br />
And Nature, mighty in her ancient ways,<br />
Who made me but for woe. "To thee be hope<br />
Denied," she said, "even hope; and in thine eyes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>No other light, save that of tears, may shine."<br />
This day was full of pleasure; from thy pastime<br />
Thou now dost take repose: perchance in dreams<br />
Those who pleased thee and whom thyself did please,<br />
Thou seest; but not I, for all my hopes,<br />
Occur unto thy fancy. I, meanwhile,<br />
I ask myself how much of life remains<br />
For me to live, and here upon the earth,<br />
Moaning and shuddering, do I throw me down<br />
In utter desolation. O ye days<br />
So full of horror for such early years!<br />
Ah, woe is me! Upon the road not far<br />
I hear a workman's solitary song;<br />
After his joyaunce, in late hours of night<br />
He is returning to his poor abode;<br />
And bitterly my heart is rent in twain<br />
When I consider all on earth doth pass<br />
And leaveth not a trace. Behold! the day<br />
Of joy is gone, and to its festive hours<br />
The day of toil succeeds, and time doth take<br />
Whate'er belongs to man. Where, where is now<br />
The pride of ancient nations? Where the fame<br />
Of our renowned forefathers, and the vast<br />
Dominion of old Rome, the clash of arms<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>Resounding o'er the ocean and the earth?<br />
All now is peace and silence, and the world<br />
Is wrapped in rest, and speaks of them no more.<br />
In those beginning years, when eagerly<br />
We seek the festive day, I lay awake<br />
When it was over, tossing full of grief<br />
Upon my bed; and in late hours of night<br />
A song I heard upon the road without,<br />
Expiring in the distance by degrees,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>With equal sorrow rent my heart in twain.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="title">TO THE MOON.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
O fair and gracious Moon! Well I remember<br />
A year hath passed, since up this very hill<br />
I came so full of anguish to behold thee:<br />
And o'er yon forest thou didst shed thy beams,<br />
As at this moment, filling it with light.<br />
But veiled in mist, and tremulous with tears<br />
That hung upon my lashes, to mine eyes<br />
Thy radiance did appear, for dark with woe<br />
Was then my life, and is, nor will it change,<br />
O Moon, thou my adored! And yet I love<br />
To bear in mind and one by one to count<br />
The slow years of my sorrow. Oh, how sweet<br />
It is to youth, when hope has yet a long,<br />
And memory has but a brief, career,<br />
To dwell in thought on things for ever past,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Though they be sad and though affliction live!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="title">SOLITUDE.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
When on his roost the cock begins to crow<br />
And beat his wings; and to his work proceeds<br />
The tiller of the soil; and on the dews<br />
The rising sun his flashing rays doth cast:<br />
Upon the panes the morning shower doth beat,<br />
Awaking me from slumber with its sound:<br />
And I arise and bless the filmy clouds,<br />
The birds that tune their notes, the pleasant wind<br />
And the delightful verdure of the meads:<br />
Because, ye walls of unpropitious towns,<br />
I've seen and known ye far too well, where Hate<br />
Haunteth Affliction, where I sorrowing live,<br />
And so shall die, would it were soon! At least<br />
Some scanty pity is allowed my grief<br />
In these abodes by Nature, once, alas!<br />
How kinder far to me! And thou as well,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>O Nature, turnest from the wretched; full<br />
Of scorn for woe, thou payest homage vile<br />
To Happiness, the universal queen.<br />
In Heaven and Earth no friend for the ill-starred,<br />
No refuge, death excepted, doth remain!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At times I seat me in a lonely spot,</span><br />
Upon a hill, or by a calm lake's bank,<br />
Fringed and adorned with flowers taciturn.<br />
There, when full mid-day heat informs the sky,<br />
His peaceful image doth the sun depict,<br />
And to the air moves neither leaf nor herb,<br />
And neither ruffling wave nor cricket shrill,<br />
Nor birds disporting in the boughs above,<br />
Nor fluttering butterfly, nor voice nor step<br />
Afar or near, can sight or hearing find.<br />
Those shores are held in deepest quietude:<br />
Whence I the world and even myself forget,<br />
Seated unmoved; and it appears to me<br />
My body is released, no longer worn<br />
With soul or feeling, and its old repose<br />
Is blended with the silence all around.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O fleeting Love! full many a day is gone</span><br />
Since from my bosom thou hast ta'en thy flight,<br />
Though fired of yore by most impassioned zeal.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>It hath been blighted by the frigid hand<br />
Of cold misfortune, and is turned to ice<br />
Even in the time when it should blossom forth.<br />
The period I remember when thou first<br />
Didst hold thy court within this heart of mine.<br />
It was the time, irrevocably sweet,<br />
When youthful eyes are opened to the scene<br />
Of earthly sorrow, and it smiles on them<br />
As though it were a paradise below.<br />
The guileless heart of youth doth gladly beat<br />
For virgin hopes and for desires sublime;<br />
And the deluded mortal doth prepare<br />
For all the labours of his days to come,<br />
As if they were a joyous festival<br />
And gay carousah&mdash;But I scarcely saw,<br />
Love, thine approach, than Fortune harsh destroyed<br />
The tenour of my life, and to these eyes<br />
Nought else was seemly than eternal tears.<br />
But if at times along the sunny meads<br />
In early morn, or when meridian rays<br />
On hills and plains and houses shed their light,<br />
I see the features of a maiden fair;<br />
Or when in the untroubled quietude<br />
Of Summer night my vagrant steps proceed<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>And guide me to the walls of near abodes,<br />
And I behold the lonely scene, and hear<br />
A maiden's thrilling voice, who in the hours<br />
Of silent night accompanies her work<br />
With joyous lay; emotion moves my heart<br />
That seemed a stone; but it, alas! returns<br />
Ere long to wonted gloom: a stranger now<br />
Is every tender feeling to my soul.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O beauteous moon, unto whose tranquil ray</span><br />
The forest things display their love; and in<br />
The early dawn the hunter doth complain,<br />
Finding their traces intricate and false,<br />
Erroneous led astray: hail, O benign<br />
Nocturnal Queen! Unwelcome falls thy light<br />
In lonely wood or mountainous recess<br />
Or ruined building empty, on the steel<br />
Of pallid bandit, who with eager ears<br />
Hearkens afar unto the sound of wheels<br />
And horses' hoofs, or to the steps that tread<br />
The quiet road; then suddenly advancing,<br />
With clanking arms, and with a rough, rude voice.<br />
And with death-boding looks, chills with alarm<br />
The wanderer's heart, and leaves him on the earth<br />
Despoiled and well-nigh dead. Unwelcome comes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Within the city precincts, thy clear light<br />
To paramour ignoble, who doth lurk<br />
Near walls and portals, hiding in the shade<br />
Of secret gloom, and standing still and dreading<br />
The lamps that through the windows pour their ray,<br />
And peopled halls. Unwelcome to base minds,<br />
To me benign for ever shall thy sight<br />
Amid the regions be, where nothing else<br />
Than happy hills and spacious fields thou showest<br />
Unto my gaze. And even I was wont,<br />
Though innocent my soul, to accuse thy ray<br />
Divinely fair in scenes inhabited,<br />
When offering me unto the sight of men,<br />
And showing human forms unto mine eye.<br />
Now shall I praise it ever, when I gaze<br />
Upon thee sailing 'mid the clouds, or thou<br />
Serenest ruler of ethereal spheres,<br />
Art looking down upon the abode of earth.<br />
Thou oft shalt see me, taciturn and lone,<br />
Wandering in bowers, or through the verdant meads,<br />
Or on the grass reclining, well content<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>If I have leisure from deep heart to sigh.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Fate hath given to our years below,</span><br />

<span class="title">THE REVIVAL.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
I thought that in me utterly<br />
In life's most fragrant flower<br />
The sweet woes had lost power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Born in my early years.</span><br />
The sweet woes and the tenderest<br />
Sighs of the heart profound,<br />
All things whereby a ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For joy in life appears.</span><br />
<br />
How many tears and murmurings<br />
Did from my new state flow,<br />
When I my heart of snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Discovered void of pain!</span><br />
Gone was the wonted agony,<br />
And love I could not hold,<br />
And this my bosom cold<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gave sighing up as vain.</span><br />
<br />
I wept that life so desolate<br />
And waste for me was made,<br />
The earth in gloom arrayed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Closed in eternal frost;</span><br />
The day forlorn, the taciturn<br />
Night more obscure and lone;<br />
For me no kind moon shone;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The stars in Heaven were lost.</span><br />
<br />
But of that grief the origin<br />
In old affection lay;<br />
Within my bosom's sway<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My heart was still alive.</span><br />
Yet for the wonted images<br />
The weary fancy sighed;<br />
My sorrow's boundless tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With pain did ever strive.</span><br />
<br />
Ere long in me that agony<br />
Of pain was wholly spent,<br />
And further to lament<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I had no courage left.</span><br />
I lay all senseless and amazed,<br />
I did not ask for balm;<br />
As though in death's last calm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My heart in twain was cleft.</span><br />
<br />
I was from him how different,<br />
In whom did ardours shine,<br />
Who errors all divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fed in his soul of yore!</span><br />
The early swallow vigilant,<br />
Who near the windows gay<br />
Salutes the rising day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Moved this my heart no more;</span><br />
<br />
Nor did the Autumn pale and sere<br />
Where lonely I might dwell;<br />
Nor did the evening bell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor sun that sought the main.</span><br />
In vain I saw bright Hesperus<br />
Shine in celestial round,<br />
In vain the valleys sound<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">With nightingale's sweet pain.</span><br />
<br />
And ye, O eyes of tenderness<br />
And glances full of joy,<br />
Ye, unto lovers coy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">First love that never dies;</span><br />
And snowy hand of whitest grace<br />
That liest in my own;<br />
In vain your power is shown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My gloomy mood ne'er flies.</span><br />
<br />
Bereft of every happiness,<br />
Sad, but not tempest-torn,<br />
I was not all forlorn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My brow became serene.</span><br />
I should have murmured for the end<br />
Of this my life of woe,<br />
If in me long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dead had desire not been.</span><br />
<br />
As in old age decrepitude<br />
Makes life disprized and bare,<br />
My years of youth most fair<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thus, thus alone were spent;</span><br />
'Twas thus the days ineffable<br />
Thou, O my heart, didst live,<br />
Days that short joyaunce give,<br />

<br />
Who the obscure, inglorious<br />
Repose bids me now miss?<br />
What virtue new is this,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This that in me I find?</span><br />
Emotions sweet, imaginings<br />
Erroneous and sublime,<br />
Are ye not for all time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The exiles of my mind?</span><br />
<br />
Are ye in truth the only ray<br />
Of these my sable years,<br />
The loves I lost with tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a more tender age?</span><br />
Though on the sky or verdant meads<br />
Or where I list, I gaze,<br />
Grief doth my soul amaze,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And yet delights assuage.</span><br />
<br />
And with my musing sympathize<br />
The plains, the woods and hills;<br />
My heart doth hear the rills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And murmur of the sea.</span><br />
Who after such forgetfulness<br />
Gives me the gift of tears?<br />
How is it the earth appears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So changed and new to me?</span><br />
<br />
Perchance fair Hope, O weary heart,<br />
Hath granted thee a smile?<br />
Ah! Hope, so full of guile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'll ne'er again behold.</span><br />
My fond delusions and desires<br />
None else than Nature gave,<br />
My native ardour brave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grief did in bondage hold,</span><br />
<br />
Though not destroy: 'twas unsubdued<br />
By misery and fate,<br />
Nor did it death await<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">From Truth's unhallowed gaze.</span><br />
To my divine imagining<br />
I know that she is strange;<br />
I know that Nature's range<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lies far from Mercy's ways;</span><br />
<br />
That not for weal solicitous<br />
She is, for life alone;<br />
She bids us live to groan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For nothing else she cares.</span><br />
I know that the unfortunate<br />
No pity find below,<br />
That from the sight of woe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Men hurry unawares;</span><br />
<br />
That this our age so reprobate<br />
Scorns virtue and renown;<br />
That glory fails to crown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The noble, learned toil.</span><br />
And you, ye eyes so tremulous,<br />
Ye glances all divine,<br />
I know you idly shine,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And far from love recoil.</span><br />
<br />
There is no wondrous, intimate<br />
Affection in your gaze;<br />
No spark ere long to blaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lies in that snowy breast;</span><br />
For it doth mock the tenderest<br />
Emotion and desire;<br />
And a celestial fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By deep scorn is distrest.</span><br />
<br />
And yet in me I feel revive<br />
The dear illusions known:<br />
My soul looks on its own<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sensations with surprise.</span><br />
From thee, my heart, this last and fair<br />
Spirit and inborn fire,<br />
All comforts in my dire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grief, but from thee arise.</span><br />
<br />
I feel my spirit is not dowered,<br />
Though lofty, sweet, and pure,<br />
By Nature, Fortune's lure,<br />

<span class="title">TO SILVIA.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Silvia, rememberest thou<br />
Yet that sweet time of thine abode on earth,<br />
When beauty graced thy brow<br />
And fired thine eyes, so radiant and so gay;<br />
And thou, so joyous, yet of pensive mood,<br />
Didst pass on youth's fair way?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The chambers calm and still,</span><br />
The sunny paths around,<br />
Did to thy song resound,<br />
When thou, upon thy handiwork intent,<br />
Wast seated, full of joy<br />
At the fair future where thy hopes were bound.<br />
It was the fragrant month of flowery May,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>And thus went by thy day.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I leaving oft behind</span><br />
The labours and the vigils of my mind,<br />
That did my life consume,<br />
And of my being far the best entomb,<br />
Bade from the casement of my father's house<br />
Mine ears give heed unto thy silver song,<br />
And to thy rapid hand<br />
That swept with skill the spinning thread along.<br />
I watched the sky serene,<br />
The radiant ways and flowers,<br />
And here the sea, the mountain there, expand.<br />
No mortal tongue can tell<br />
What made my bosom swell.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What thoughts divinely sweet,</span><br />
What hopes, O Silvia! and what souls were ours!<br />
In what guise did we meet<br />
Our destiny and life?<br />
When I remember such aspiring flown,<br />
Fierce pain invades my soul,<br />
Which nothing can console,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>And my misfortune I again bemoan.<br />
O Nature, void of ruth,<br />
Why not give some return<br />
For those fair promises? Why full of fraud<br />
Thy wretched offspring spurn?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou ere the herbs by winter were destroyed,</span><br />
Led to the grave by an unknown disease,<br />
Didst perish, tender blossom: thy life's flower<br />
Was not by thee enjoyed;<br />
Nor heard, thy heart to please,<br />
The admiration of thy raven hair<br />
Or of the enamoured glances of thine eyes;<br />
Nor thy companions in the festive hour<br />
Spoke of love's joys and sighs.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ere long my hope as well</span><br />
Was dead and gone. By cruel Fate's decree<br />
Was youthfulness denied<br />
Unto my years. Ah me!<br />
How art thou past for aye,<br />
Thou dear companion of my earlier day,<br />
My hope so much bewailed!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Is this the world? Are these<br />
The joys, the loves, the labours and the deeds<br />
Whereof so often we together spoke?<br />
Is this the doom to which mankind proceeds?<br />
When truth before thee lay<br />
Revealed, thou sankest; and thy dying hand<br />
Pointed to death, a figure of cold gloom,<br />

<br />
<span class="title">THE MEMORIES.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Ye stars of Ursa's sign, I did not think<br />
I should return, as formerly, to gaze<br />
Upon you, shining on my father's garden,<br />
And with you to hold parley from the windows<br />
Of this old mansion where in youth I dwelt,<br />
And of my joys beheld the bitter end.<br />
How many strange imaginings of yore<br />
Your aspect and the stars that near you shine,<br />
Created in my thoughts when 'twas my wont,<br />
In silence wrapped, on verdant sward reclining,<br />
To pass the hours of evening, gazing long<br />
Upon the sky and list'ning to the sound<br />
That issued from frog-haunted marshes far.<br />
'Twas then the glow-worm hovered round the hedges<br />
And o'er the beds of flowers; while to the wind<br />
The fragrant alleys rustled, and beyond<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>The cypress forest moaned; and 'neath our roof<br />
Voices proceeded, and the quiet work<br />
Of the attendants. And what thoughts immense,<br />
What sweetest dreams inspired me at the view<br />
Of that far-distant sea, those azure mountains,<br />
Which yonder I discern, and which some day<br />
I hoped to cross, an unknown world, unknown<br />
Felicity depicting to my years!<br />
This life of mine, so painful and so bare,<br />
I willingly with death would have exchanged!<br />
<br />
Nor did my heart foretell I should be doomed<br />
To consummate my youthful years in this<br />
My native hamlet rude; amid a race<br />
Ribaldrous, vile; to which are names most strange,<br />
And often themes of mockery and jibes,<br />
Learning and science; and it hates and shuns me,<br />
Not out of envy, for it does not deem<br />
My worth superior, but because it knows<br />
That in my heart I think so, though thereof<br />
An outward sign to none I ever gave.<br />
Here do I pass my years, abandoned, hidden,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>And without love or life; and needs amid<br />
A rabble so malignant, bitter grow;<br />
Here I discard all pity and all virtue,<br />
And a despiser of mankind become,<br />
Because of those around me; and, meanwhile,<br />
The cherished time of youth escapes, more dear<br />
Than fame or laurels, dearer than the pure<br />
Radiance of day and vital breath; I lose thee<br />
Without a joy, and uselessly, in this<br />
Inhuman dwelling-place, immersed in woes,<br />
Of barren life thou solitary flower!<br />
<br />
I hear the wind that wafts the striking time<br />
From yonder village-clock. I well remember<br />
That sound was the sole comfort to my nights,<br />
When as a child, in darkness of my room,<br />
I passed a sleepless vigil, full of terrors,<br />
Sighing for day. Around me there is nothing<br />
I see or hear, whence fancies old do not<br />
Return, or sweet remembrances arise,<br />
Sweet in themselves; but full of pain appears<br />
The present to my mind, the vain desire<br />
For what is past, though sad, the thought "I was!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Yon loggia, turned towards the dying light<br />
Of the expiring day; these pictured walls,<br />
Those herds that live in painting, and the sun<br />
O'er lonely country rising, to my leisure<br />
Gave many joys, what time my mighty error<br />
Beside me stood, wherever I might be,<br />
Prompting my heart. Here in these ancient halls,<br />
When shone the snow without, and stormy blasts<br />
Were whistling round these ample windows high,<br />
My pleasures had their scene, and my gay laugh<br />
Re-echoed in that time when we suppose<br />
The bitter, cruel mystery of things<br />
Entirely sweet; an inexperienced lover,<br />
Admiring heavenly beauty he conceives,<br />
The youth pays court unto his life which yet<br />
Before him lies untasted, unconsumed.<br />
<br />
Ye hopes, ye vanished hopes, ye sweet illusions<br />
Of my beginning years! always in song<br />
To you I come; and although time doth fly,<br />
And thoughts do change, and even affections vary,<br />
Forget you, I shall never. Shades, I know,<br />
Are glory and honour, riches and delight,<br />
Merest desire; life doth not yield a fruit,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>Tis useless misery. And although empty<br />
Are these my years, and desolate and dark<br />
My lot on earth, I see that fortune keeps<br />
Little from me. Alas! but when my thoughts<br />
Recur to you, oh ye my ancient hopes!<br />
And to my fond imagining of yore,<br />
And then consider my existence, made<br />
So painful and so vile that death is all<br />
That of such high aspiring still is mine:<br />
I feel my heart contract, I feel that wholly<br />
There is no consolation for my fate.<br />
And when at last this long implored for death<br />
Shall come to me, and thus the end be reached<br />
Of all my woes; when to my soul this earth<br />
Shall be a vale remote; and from my sight<br />
The future shall escape: of ye in truth<br />
I will be mindful, and even then your image<br />
Will make me sigh, will make the thought most bitter<br />
That I have lived in vain, and even the sweetness<br />
Of dying it will temper with affliction.<br />
<br />
Even in the earliest youthful turbulence<br />
Of happiness, of anguish, of desire,<br />
I often called for death; and long I sat<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Out there, upon the margin of yon fountain,<br />
And thought of ending in that lucid stream<br />
My hope and pain. But soon Misfortune blind<br />
Conducted me through life's most various maze,<br />
And I then wept for youth and for the flower<br />
Of my ill-fated days, that ere its time<br />
Withered; and often through belated hours<br />
Upon my bed reclining, mournfully<br />
Conning my verses at the lamp's dim ray,<br />
With silence and with night I did lament<br />
My spirit flying hence, and on myself<br />
In languid pain a funeral dirge I sang.<br />
<br />
Who without sighing can remember ye,<br />
O early dawn of youth, O happy days<br />
Charming beyond narration? When on man<br />
Fair women first do smile and make him blest<br />
With tokens of their love; when all around<br />
Is radiant; when even envy still is silent,<br />
Not yet roused, or else kind; and when it seems,<br />
Oh unaccustomed miracle! the world<br />
Doth offer him a helping, generous hand,<br />
Forgives his errors, celebrated his new<br />
Arrival in this life, and full of homage<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Appears to hail him and receive him lord?<br />
Ah fleeting days! As swift as lightning's flash<br />
They disappear. And who of those on earth<br />
Can be to woe a stranger, if for him<br />
That season is no more, if his fair time,<br />
If youth, ah youth! for evermore be gone?<br />
<br />
O my Nerina I and perchance of thee<br />
These scenes I hear not tell? Art thou perchance<br />
Fallen from my recollection? Where art thou,<br />
That here of thee the memory alone<br />
I find, my sweetest love? This native soil<br />
Sees thee no more; that window, whence thy wont<br />
It was to hold discourse with me, and whence<br />
Sadly the starry radiance is reflected,<br />
Is desolate. Where art thou, that no more<br />
I hear thy voice as in a former day,<br />
When every distant accent from thy lips<br />
That reached mine ear, had in it such a charm,<br />
It changed my hue? Those times are gone. Those days<br />
Are over, my adored. Thou passedst. Others<br />
By Fate are now allowed on earth to live<br />
And make their dwelling 'mid these fragrant hills.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>But far too rapidly thy life did end,<br />
Even as a dream. It was thy wont to dance,<br />
And on thy brow shone joy, and in thine eyes<br />
That fond imagining, that radiant light<br />
Of youth, when Fate extinguished them, and thou<br />
Didst lie in death. Ah me, Nerina! Still<br />
The old love reigns in my heart. If I at times<br />
To festive pleasures go, unto myself<br />
I say: "Alas, Nerina I For such joys<br />
Thou dost no more array thee, nor proceed."<br />
If May returns, and flowers and roundelays<br />
The lovers offer to their well-beloved,<br />
I say, "Nerina mine! for thee no more<br />
Doth Spring return, nor do the sweets of love."<br />
Each day serene in beauty, and each bed<br />
Of flowers I see, each joyaunce that I feel,<br />
I say: "Nerina now no more enjoys them,<br />
Nor sees the earth and sky." Ah, thou art gone,<br />
Thou my eternal sigh, gone: and united<br />
With all my musings, with my tenderest feelings,<br />
And with the heart's emotions, sad yet dear.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Shall be for aye the bitter memory.<br />

<span class="title">THE NOCTURNAL SONG</span><br />
<br />
<span class="title">OF A</span><br />
<br />
<span class="title">NOMADIC SHEPHERD IN ASIA.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Wherefore, O Moon, art thou on high? O say,<br />
Thou silent Moon serene!<br />
At night thou dost proceed,<br />
Our waste beholding, then dost sink to rest.<br />
Hast thou ne'er weary been<br />
Of repursuing the everlasting way?<br />
Untired as yet, still takest thou delight<br />
On earth to turn thy sight?<br />
Even as thy life on high,<br />
The shepherd's life doth fly.<br />
When dawn succeeds to night,<br />
He sallies forth and leads his flock to graze.<br />
He sees the grass and flowers,<br />
And, weary, resteth in nocturnal hours,<br />
Nor other hope doth raise.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Say, Moon, what boots his life<br />
To humble swain, or thy<br />
Divine existence unto thee on high?<br />
Where doth my life below,<br />
Thy course immortal go?<br />
<br />
Even as an old man bent,<br />
Ragged and white of hair,<br />
Whose aching shoulders grievous fardels bear,<br />
O'er mountains and through vales,<br />
O'er pointed rocks, through sandy wastes, through marshes,<br />
A prey to winds, to tempests, to fierce heat,<br />
To snow, to ice, to sleet,<br />
Still toils upon his way,<br />
Through sloughs and torrents goes,<br />
Falls, rises, hurries as though time were brief,<br />
Without rest or relief,<br />
Footsore and suffering, until he arrives<br />
Where his long path did tend,<br />
Where all his weary wandering finds an end:<br />
A dread abyss profound<br />
Where dark oblivion grasps him as her prey:<br />
Thou virgin Moon, even so<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Is this our life below.<br />
<br />
Man draws for toil his breath,<br />
And birth itself is on the verge of death.<br />
In pain and suffering dire<br />
His days begin, and in life's early morn<br />
His mother and his sire<br />
Try to console him that he e'er was born.<br />
As he in years doth grow,<br />
They help him onwards, and for ever strive,<br />
By action and by word,<br />
To keep his hope alive,<br />
And to console him for our fate below:<br />
Nor any way more kind<br />
Their fondness to display, can parents find.<br />
But why give to the light,<br />
Why with life animate<br />
A wretched spirit ever seeking balm?<br />
If heavy be our fate,<br />
Why do we bear its weight?<br />
O virgin Moon, even so<br />
Is this our life below.<br />
But thou in region calm<br />
Dost little heed upon my wail bestow.<br />
<br />
Eternal pilgrim on thy lonely way,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Who full of thought dost shed thy silver ray,<br />
Perchance to thee well known<br />
Are life and suffering and distressful moan;<br />
Thou knowest what is death, what the supreme<br />
Grey pallor of the face,<br />
The earth that leaveth not a mental trace,<br />
And the awakening from our life's deep dream.<br />
And thou, in truth, dost see<br />
The cause of things, and what the fruit may be<br />
Of morning and of night,<br />
And of Time's silent, never-ending flight.<br />
Thou knowest, in truth, what tender love and sweet<br />
Spring with its buds doth greet,<br />
Why summer heats arise, and what device<br />
Brings winter with its ice.<br />
A thousand things unto thy soul are plain,<br />
Which are but riddles to the simple swain.<br />
Oft when I see thee shine<br />
In lonely sphere and solemn state divine<br />
Upon our waste that stretches to the skies;<br />
Or when my flock I lead<br />
And see thy radiance on my path proceed,<br />
And when the stars' clear rays attract mine eyes,<br />
Within my soul I say:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>"What means so many a ray?<br />
Where goes the wind? what booteth in the sky<br />
The endless space serene? What is the thought<br />
Of this vast solitude, and what am I?"<br />
Thus my amazement to express I sought,<br />
Nor of the proud abode,<br />
Too vast in size, nor of the unnumbered race,<br />
Nor of the labours and the powers that goad<br />
All things of earth and of the realms divine,<br />
Revolving without rest,<br />
To be again where they commenced their road:<br />
Of all I cannot trace<br />
The use or meaning. Surely thou art blest<br />
With deeper lore, who in the spheres dost shine.<br />
I only know and feel,<br />
Of all the skies reveal,<br />
Of my frail life below,<br />
That unto me existence is but woe.<br />
<br />
O thou, my flock that liest in repose!<br />
Thrice blessed thou, unconscious of distress!<br />
How much I envy thee!<br />
Nor merely that from woes<br />
Thy destiny is free,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>Nor that all things unkind,<br />
All sudden fears soon vanish from thy mind;<br />
But most because thou knowest not weariness.<br />
When lying on a grassy plot in shade,<br />
Thou art contented made.<br />
A long part of the year<br />
Thus flies by thee, and not a care is near.<br />
And I as well on grassy plot in shade<br />
My body oft have laid;<br />
But weariness lies heavy on my soul;<br />
And, seated, I am further from the goal<br />
Of peace and sweet repose.<br />
And yet I yearn for nought,<br />
Nor have I any reason for my woes.<br />
What makes thy happy state<br />
I cannot say; but thou art fortunate,<br />
And I have little joy,<br />
My flock; nor therein lies my whole annoy.<br />
If thou couldst speak, I'd ask<br />
Why, lying in calm shade,<br />
All beasts are happy made;<br />
But when I leisure know<br />
I am assailed by weariness and woe?<br />
<br />
If wings perchance had I<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Above the clouds to fly,<br />
And one by one the radiant stars to count,<br />
Or like fierce thunder o'er the crags to roam,<br />
I should be happier, thou my gentle flock,<br />
I should be happier, virgin Moon on high.<br />
Or else, perchance, my thought<br />
By vagrant dreams is full of errors fraught;<br />
Perchance in every form<br />
That Nature may on everything bestow,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>The day of birth brings everlasting woe.<br />

<span class="title">THE RULING THOUGHT.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Omnipotent and kind,<br />
Lord of the deep recesses of my mind;<br />
In terrors clad, yet dear<br />
Gift of the skies; so near<br />
In my gloom-darkened days,<br />
Thought upon which so oft I fix my gaze:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy nature unrevealed</span><br />
Who doth not contemplate? Who wears a shield<br />
Impervious to thy power?<br />
Though tongue of man must say<br />
What passion in his bosom beareth sway,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>All thou may'st utter seemeth new for aye.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How like a hermit lone</span><br />
Was this my spirit made<br />
Even from the time thou didst my mind invade!<br />
As rapidly as lightnings flash and die,<br />
My other thoughts did fade,<br />
Not one remaining. Like a strong tower, high<br />
On solitary plain,<br />
Thou, lonely giant, o'er my soul dost reign.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What to my visionary gaze became</span><br />
All things of earth, and all<br />
That life can give, alone excepting thee!<br />
How on my spirit pall<br />
The labours and the leisure,<br />
And vain desiring of still vainer pleasure,<br />
Compared unto that joy,<br />
That heavenly joy, which maketh thee my treasure!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As from the naked peaks</span><br />
Of rugged Appenine,<br />
With longing gaze the weary pilgrim seeks<br />
The verdant meads that in the distance shine:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Thus from the harsh and dry<br />
Scene of the world, to thee I gladly fly,<br />
As to a beauteous garden, and I find<br />
Thy fair abode unto my spirit kind.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I scarcely can believe</span><br />
That I this life and our ignoble world<br />
For years of weary length<br />
Without thee had the strength<br />
To bear. Hard to conceive<br />
It is that men aspire,<br />
Ignoring thee, to many a vain desire.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ne'er from the hour when first</span><br />
Experience taught me what this life can be,<br />
Did fear of death bring terror to my heart;<br />
And now a jest to me<br />
Seems what the world so base<br />
At times extols, but never dares to face,<br />
The necessary end:<br />
If any peril falleth to my part,<br />
Before its threat my spirit doth not bend.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I always held in scorn</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>The craven and the mean;<br />
Now every deed, of lowly baseness born,<br />
Doth move my spirit keen;<br />
My soul doth flash with ire<br />
When human vileness desolates my view.<br />
This haughty age untrue,<br />
Feeding itself on barren hopes and vain,<br />
To folly gentle, and to virtue dire,<br />
That asks for things of use,<br />
Nor sees by what abuse<br />
Our life becometh useless more and more,<br />
I loathe, arising o'er<br />
Its meanness. Human acts I ne'er esteem;<br />
The crowd that doth disdain<br />
Thy loveliness, in all I worthless deem.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What passion doth not yield</span><br />
To that inspired by thee?<br />
The one thou hast revealed<br />
Alone rules man in sovran majesty.<br />
Pride, hatred, avarice and fierce disdain,<br />
The zeal to shine and reign,<br />

<span class="title"> ASPASIA.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Again at times appeareth to my thought<br />
Thy semblance, O Aspasia I either flashing<br />
Across my path amid the haunts of men<br />
In other forms; or 'mid deserted fields<br />
When shines the sun or tranquil host of stars,<br />
As by the sweetest harmony awoke,<br />
Arising in my soul which seems once more<br />
To yield unto that vision all superb,<br />
How much adored, O Heaven I of yore how fully<br />
The joyaunce and the halo of my life?<br />
I never meet the perfume of the gardens,<br />
Or of the flowers that cities may display,<br />
Without beholding thee as thou appearedst<br />
Upon that day, when in thy splendid rooms<br />
Which gave the perfume of the sweetest flowers<br />
Of recent Spring, arrayed in robes that bore<br />
The violet's hue, first thine angelic form<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Did meet my gaze as thou, reclining, layest<br />
On strange, white furs, and deep, voluptuous charm<br />
Seemed to be thine, whilst thou, a skilled enchantress<br />
Of loving hearts, upon the rosy lips<br />
Of thy fair children many a fervent kiss<br />
Imprintedst, bending down to them thy neck<br />
Of snowy beauty, and with lovely hand<br />
Their guileless forms, unconscious of thy wile,<br />
Clasping unto thy bosom, so desired,<br />
Though hidden. To the visions of my soul<br />
Another sky and more entrancing world<br />
And radiance as from heaven were revealed.<br />
Thus in my heart, though not unarmed, thy power<br />
Infixed the arrow which I wounded bore,<br />
Until that day when the revolving earth<br />
A second time her yearly course fulfilled.<br />
<br />
A ray divine unto my thought appeared,<br />
Lady, thy beauty. Similar effects<br />
Beauty and music's harmony produce,<br />
Revealing both the mysteries sublime<br />
Of unknown Eden. Thence the loving soul,<br />
Though injured in his love, adores the birth<br />
Of his fond mind, the amorous idea<br />
That doth include Olympus in its range,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>And seems in face, in manner, and in speech<br />
Like unto her whom the enchanted lover<br />
Fancies alone to cherish and admire.<br />
Not her, but that sweet image, he doth clasp<br />
Even in the raptures of a fond embrace,<br />
At last his error and the objects changed<br />
Perceiving, wrath invades him, and he oft<br />
Wrongly accuses her he thought he loved.<br />
The mind of woman to that lofty height<br />
Rarely ascends, and what her charms inspire<br />
She little thinks and seldom understands.<br />
So frail a mind can harbour no such thought;<br />
In vain doth man, deluded by the light<br />
Of those enthralling eyes, indulge in hope;<br />
In vain he asks for deep and hidden thoughts,<br />
Transcending mortal ken, of her to whom<br />
Hath Nature's laws a lesser rank assigned,<br />
For as her frame less strength than man's received,<br />
So too her mind less energy and depth.?<br />
<br />
Nor thou as yet what inspirations vast<br />
Within my thought thy loveliness aroused,<br />
Aspasia, could'st conceive. Thou little knowest<br />
What love unmeasured and what woes intense,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>What frenzy wild and feelings without name,<br />
Thou didst within me move, nor shall the time<br />
Appear when thou canst know it. Equally<br />
The skilled performer ignorant remains<br />
Of what with hand or voice he doth arouse<br />
Within his hearers. That Aspasia now<br />
Is dead, whom I so worshipped. She lies low<br />
For evermore, once idol of my life:<br />
Unless at times, a cherished shade, she rises,<br />
Ere long to vanish. Thou art still alive,<br />
Not merely lovely, but of such perfection<br />
That, as I think, thou dost eclipse the rest.<br />
But now the ardour, born of thee, is spent:<br />
Because I loved not thee, but that fair goddess<br />
Who had her dwelling in me, now her grave.<br />
Her long I worshipped, and so was I pleased<br />
By her celestial loveliness, that I,<br />
Even from the first full conscious and aware<br />
Of what thou art, so wily and so false,<br />
Beholding in thine eyes the light of hers,<br />
Fondly pursued thee while she lived in me;<br />
Not dazzled or deluded; but induced<br />
By the enjoyment of that sweet resemblance,<br />
A long and bitter slavery to bear.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Now boast, for well thou may'st; say that alone<br />
Of all thy sex art thou to whom I bent<br />
My haughty head, to whom I gladly gave<br />
My heart in homage. Say that thou wert first<br />
And last, I truly hope, to see mine eyes'<br />
Imploring gaze, and me before thee stand<br />
Timid and fearful (as I write, I burn<br />
With wrath and shame); me of myself deprived,<br />
Each look of thine, each gesture and each word<br />
Observing meekly; at thy haughty freaks<br />
Pale and subdued; then radiant with delight<br />
At any sign of favour; changing hue<br />
At every glance of thine. The charm is gone;<br />
And with it shattered, falls the heavy yoke,<br />
Whence I rejoice. Though weariness be with me,<br />
Yet after such delirium and long thraldom,<br />
Gladly my freedom I again embrace,<br />
And my unshackled mind. For if a life<br />
Void of affections and of errors sweet,<br />
Be like a starless night in winter's depth,<br />
Revenge sufficient and sufficient balm<br />
It is to me that here upon the grass<br />
Leisurely lying and unmoved, I gaze<br />

Dost thou depart before thy days are old?<br />
Say, wilt thou ne'er return? No more rejoice<br />

The joys of times desired<br />
Beneath the silent tombstone lying dead:<br />
If in this doom the mind<br />
Some happiness can find,<br />
Even sternest heart with pity must be fired.<br />

By mortal races from their earliest days,<br />

Why her, who doth control<br />
Our future, looming darkly in our soul,<br />
Why her, who is the balm<br />
To these our days ne'er calm,<br />
In sable robes array,<br />
Involve in shadows grey?<br />

With lava petrified,<br />
<br />
Resounding to the pilgrim as he treads:<br />
Where we see twining in the sun the snake,<br />
And where in caverns dark<br />
The timorous hares their wonted refuge take:<br />
Were happy homes, and fields,<br />
Like those where harvest now its rich boon yields,<br />
Alive with lowing herds;<br />
They were palatial halls<br />
And wondrous gardens, dear<br />
Unto the great, and famous cities' walls:<br />
All which the haughty mountain with the torrents<br />
That from his fiery crater ruthless rolled,<br />
Crushed, while their inmates were by death destroyed.<br />
Now ruin makes a void<br />
Of all around where, beauteous flower, thou growest,<br />
And as in pity for the scene of woe<br />
Upon the air a perfume sweet bestowest,<br />
Consoling to the desert. To this shore<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>Let him proceed whose wont it is to praise<br />
Our earthly state, and let him see how much<br />
Our race is held in care<br />
By loving Nature. And he here as well<br />
Can more exactly tell<br />
How far extends the power of human kind,<br />
Whom its harsh tyrant, when it least may fear,<br />
With slight exertion can destroy in part,<br />
And with a little more<br />
Could in an instant wholly sweep away,<br />
Annihilate, and slay.<br />
Upon these shores are seen<br />
Of our poor human race<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here gaze as on a mirror,</span><br />
Thou age unwise and proud,<br />
Who errest from the way<br />
That rising thought illumined with its ray,<br />
And as thy steps a backward course pursue,<br />
Art glad of thy return,<br />
Which seemeth progress to thy troubled view.<br />
Thy folly by all minds<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>Whose evil destiny made thee their sire,<br />
Is pampered, even though<br />
They, when unheeded, throw<br />
Disdain on thee. Not I<br />
Will so inglorious sink into my grave,<br />
'Twere easy enough, I know,<br />
For me to join the others in their wrong<br />
And to thine ears melodious make my song:<br />
But rather the disdain of thee that lies<br />
Within my bosom deep,<br />
I shall, as widely as I can, display,<br />
Although neglect for those<br />
Be held in store who much their age oppose.<br />
This evil which I've borne<br />
With thee in common, moved till now my scorn.<br />
Fair freedom is the subject of thy dreams:<br />
Yet thou enslavest thought,<br />
By whom alone we're brought<br />
From rudeness by degrees, by whom alone<br />
Is culture fostered, who alone can send<br />
The fate of nations to a better end.<br />
So much didst thou in horror hold the truth<br />
Of the harsh doom and dungeon-like abode<br />
That Nature gave us. Therefore didst thou turn,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>With craven soul, thy vision from the light<br />
That made it clear; and in thy flight dost spurn<br />
As vile who seek its rays,<br />
And him alone dost praise,<br />
Who, scornful of himself or of the rest,<br />
Above the stars says man's degree is blest.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He, poor of state and suffering of frame,</span><br />
Who has a generous and lofty soul,<br />
Doth not the homage claim<br />
That gold and strength procure,<br />
Nor of a splendid life and figure proud<br />
Maketh among the crowd<br />
An empty show absurd;<br />
But not with treasures or with vigour blessed<br />
He owns himself unfeigning, and is heard<br />
In discourse to be candid on himself,<br />
Still giving truth its due.<br />
Unwise I hold his mind,<br />
And not of loftier kind,<br />
Who, born to perish and in sorrow bred,<br />
?Says: "I am made for joy;"<br />
And with unhallowed pride<br />
The annals of humanity supplied,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>Grand destinies and wondrous happiness,<br />
Which even to Heaven are strange, not to our globe<br />
Alone, predicting here<br />
To those whom stormy wave<br />
Or breath of air malignant, or the shock<br />
Of earthquake, so destroys<br />
That Memory scarcely lingers o'er their grave.<br />
A noble nature he<br />
Who with a spirit free<br />
Dares mortal eye to raise<br />
Upon our common fate; who with bold tongue,<br />
Debarring nought from truth,<br />
Owneth the evil Fortune bade prevail,<br />
And our low state and frail;<br />
Who in affliction dire<br />
Shows fortitude and lofty strength of soul,<br />
Nor the fraternal hatred and the ire<br />
So frequent on our earth, and worst of ills,<br />
Unto his misery addeth by declaring<br />
Man guilty of his woe, but casteth blame<br />
On her alone who merits all the shame,<br />
Who gives birth to mankind,<br />
But all whose deeds we harsh and cruel find.<br />
Her he calls hostile; and considering men,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>As truth itself declares,<br />
In union joined against her evil ways<br />
By social bonds of old,<br />
He as confederates doth all mortals hold<br />
Among themselves, and all<br />
With equal love surveys,<br />
And giveth aid where 'tis desired and needed<br />
In various peril and disastrous ways,<br />
Beset by common warfare. And to raise<br />
A vengeful hand for injuries of men,<br />
Our neighbour to destroy,<br />
So ill-advised he deems as on the field<br />
Of battle, close surrounded by the foe,<br />
When most the fight doth rage<br />
Against our friends to wage<br />
Disastrous war, oblivious of the rest,<br />
And with pernicious sword<br />
To spread dismay and slaughter 'mid their ranks.<br />
When thoughts like these are made,<br />
As once they were, unto the nations known,<br />
By real knowledge in its influence vast;<br />
And the dread horror shown<br />
That first 'gainst Nature bade<br />
Our humankind in social chain unite:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>Then shall the just, the honest and the right,<br />
And patriotic fire,<br />
And mercy find a more enduring source<br />
Than is supplied by haughty dreams and vain<br />
That now the vulgar righteousness sustain,<br />
Which proves itself even so<br />
As everything that doth from error flow.<a name="FNanchor_10_12" id="FNanchor_10_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_12" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Full often on this shore,</span><br />
Clad by the hardened flood<br />
Of lava in a garment dark of hue<br />
That seems to surge, I seat myself at night,<br />
And shining on the saddened land, the stars<br />
In plains of purest azure meet my view,<br />
Reflected by the deep;<br />
And through the space serene in circles vast<br />
The sparkling Heavens open on my sight,<br />
And when my vision on those lights I cast,<br />
That seem so small to be,<br />
And are in truth so large<br />
That by their side would shrivel land and sea<br />
To nothingness; to whom<br />
Not humankind alone<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>Is utterly unknown,<br />
But even this globe where man is less than nought;<br />
And when I gaze upon those clustering stars<br />
In greater distance without any end,<br />
Seeming to us like vapour, unto whom<br />
Not merely man and not the earth he treads,<br />
But all the stars, the neighbours of our world,<br />
And even the golden radiance of the Sun,<br />
Were never known, or else appear as they<br />
Unto our sight, a spot<br />
Of luminous mist: what then unto my thought,<br />
Becomest thou, mankind?<br />
And when I bear in mind<br />
Thy state below, whereof the signs are seen<br />
Upon the soil I tread: and when I think<br />
Thy pride doth call thee queen<br />
And end of all, and how thou lovest oft<br />
To fable that unto this grain obscure<br />
Of wretched dust which bears the name of earth,<br />
For love of thee, of universal things<br />
The lords descended, and were known to dwell<br />
Benignly in thy midst: and that the dreams<br />
So idle even the present age renews,<br />
Opprobrious to the wise, although it seems<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>In knowledge and in deed<br />
Superior to the past: what passion fires,<br />
O hapless race of man, what thought inspires<br />
For thee my heart? In truth, I cannot say<br />
If mockery or if pity beareth sway.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As from its tree a ripened apple falling,</span><br />
By Autumn's power, nought else,<br />
Cast on the earth in full maturity,<br />
Crushes and overwhelms<br />
The populous abode of busy ants,<br />
Destroying all their hoarded treasures vast,<br />
The fruit of summer toil,<br />
Which they had piled in those elaborate caves<br />
Formed by their cunning in the yielding soil:<br />
Even thus in dread and thundering fury cast<br />
From the deep rumbling womb<br />
Of yon destructive mountain in its ire,<br />
Night and destruction in a cloud of ashes,<br />
Of rocks and lurid fire,<br />
Fall on the land devoted to its doom;<br />
And boiling torrents run<br />
And down the mountain flow<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>With rapid wrath and all-consuming rage;<br />
And o'er the verdure falls<br />
A furious rush and grand<br />
Of liquid metal and of fiery sand,<br />
Such as o'erwhelmed the cities on the shore,<br />
And in an instant they were seen no more.<br />
On their deserted site<br />
We see the browzing goat,<br />
And other cities we behold arise,<br />
Beneath whose splendid domes<br />
Full many a vast and ancient ruin lies;<br />
And even these lofty walls<br />
The haughty mountain threatens and appals.<br />
Nature no more doth hold<br />
In tenderness and love<br />
The race of man than insects of the earth;<br />
And if we in mankind<br />
May less destruction find,<br />
'Tis that of offspring it has greater dearth.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One thousand and eight hundred years have passed</span><br />
Since by the force of subterranean fire<br />
The peopled cities found an end so dire;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>And still the peasant full of anxious fears<br />
For what he planted on the arid soil,<br />
Amid the death-like ashes and the stones,<br />
Suspicious turns his eye<br />
To where he sees, aspiring to the sky,<br />
The fatal peak, as cruel as of yore,<br />
For ever threatening ruin to his home.<br />
And oft at night, alarmed,<br />
Lying for sleepless hours,<br />
In terror listening to the wandering wind,<br />
At last he rises and ascends his roof,<br />
And gazes thence upon the dreaded course<br />
Of boiling lava, rushing from the womb<br />
Of the unexhausted mount,<br />
O'er sandy ridge, and casting lurid light<br />
On Capri's distant strand,<br />
On Naples' bay and Mergellina's land.<br />
He wakes his children and his trembling wife,<br />
If he perceives it coming, or within<br />
His household well heats seething waters boil;<br />
And with whatever they can snatch in haste,<br />
Away they rush, and witness from afar<br />
Their dwelling and their field,<br />
From hunger and despair their only shield,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>By the disastrous torrents soon laid waste,<br />
That fiercely rush and cruelly invade,<br />
And lie for ever on the wreck they've made.<br />
Even as a skeleton that from its grave<br />
Is brought to light by piety or greed,<br />
The dead Pompeii to the realms of day<br />
From old oblivion doth again proceed:<br />
And from the ruined Forum and the file<br />
Of shattered columns tall,<br />
The wanderer gazes on the cloven peak<br />
And on the smoky crest,<br />
Still threatening even the ruins in their fall<br />
And in the horror of the secret night,<br />
Among theatres empty and forlorn,<br />
Among the mouldering temples and among<br />
The shattered houses where the bat doth hide,<br />
Like an ill-omened torch<br />
In empty fanes and halls untenanted,<br />
The terrors run of the funereal stream,<br />
Which in the shade doth gleam<br />
And tinges all around with fiery red.<br />
Of man unconscious and of all the years<br />
That he calls old, and offspring laid by sire,<br />
Thus Nature stands in ever-blooming youth;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>Or rather, she proceeds<br />
Upon a path so long, a course so wide,<br />
That to our eyes she never seems to move.<br />
Meanwhile realms fall, and tongues and nations wane<br />
She seeth nought, and man doth still presume<br />
Eternity to claim in haughty pride.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And thou, slow-spreading flower,</span><br />
With many an odorous wood,<br />
Who dost adorn these regions desolate;<br />
Thou too ere long shalt sink beneath the power<br />
Of the unpitying subterranean fire,<br />
Which will extend its ire,<br />
Returning to the scene it knew of old,<br />
Unto thy gentle forests, and beneath<br />
The fatal weight thou wilt thy head incline,<br />
Though innocent, without a murmuring wail,<br />
But not till then in cowardice cast down<br />
With supplication and imploring prayer<br />
Before the future tyrant, but not raised<br />
With frenzied pride unto the very stars,<br />
Nor on the desert where<br />
Thou hadst thy dwelling-place,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>Not by thy will, by the decree of Fate:<br />
<br />
But wiser far, and less<br />
Ill-starred than man, because thou didst not think.<br />
<br />
Thy race endowed by Doom,<br />
Or by thyself, with an immortal bloom.<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
